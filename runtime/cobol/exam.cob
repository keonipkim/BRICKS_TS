      *> When the user types "EXAM 1 2 3" at the blank prompt, the
      *> dispatcher stashes the unedited line on the TCB and the
      *> following EXEC CICS RECEIVE INTO(buf) LENGTH(len) returns the
      *> whole buffer including the transid prefix. The program then
      *> strips the transid with UNSTRING (whose first piece is the
      *> transid itself) and surfaces A / B / C on the EXAM1 map.
      *>
      *> This is the IBM-canonical surface: real CICS programs read the
      *> first-dispatch terminal input the same way. A second RECEIVE
      *> in this same task, or any RECEIVE in a chained RETURN TRANSID
      *> task, returns RESP-EOC -- see the named-constant branch below
      *> in MAIN. The RESP-EOC name (and its DFHRESP-EOC alias) come
      *> from COPY DFHRESP.
