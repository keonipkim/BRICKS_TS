      *>   1. EXEC CICS GETMAIN SET(WS-PTR) FLENGTH(...) grabs a task-heap
      *>      buffer and writes its handle into the USAGE POINTER item.
      *>   2. SET ADDRESS OF a based LINKAGE 01 (GM-AREA) TO that handle
      *>      maps the record onto the GETMAIN bytes; a MOVE then writes
      *>      through the based item and a read pulls the same bytes back.
      *>   3. EXEC CICS FREEMAIN DATAPOINTER(WS-PTR) releases the buffer
      *>      while WS-PTR still holds the GETMAIN handle.
      *>   4. EXEC CICS ADDRESS COMMAREA(WS-CPTR) / EIB(WS-EPTR) hand back
      *>      handles addressing DFHCOMMAREA and the DFHEIB block. We test
      *>      the COMMAREA length against 0 so the operator can see
