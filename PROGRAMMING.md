## About this publication

This reference describes the application-programming interface of the **Bricks Transaction Server**: the COBOL and REXX languages it accepts, the `EXEC CICS` command set those programs may issue, the `EXEC SQL` embedded database surface, the `EXEC CICS WEB` command family for HTTP service, the BMS-flavoured map DSL used to build 3270 panels, the VSAM and temporary-storage queue surfaces, and the catalogue of sample programs shipped under `runtime/`.

Operational and installation topics — running `bricks`, editing `bricks.cnf`, signing on through CSSN, the CEMT master terminal, the `bricksload` stress tester, and the `/metrics` endpoint — are documented in the companion **README.md**.

### Who should read this publication

This manual is for application programmers who write transactions that run under Bricks. Familiarity with the IBM CICS programming model (pseudo-conversational dispatch, the **EIB**, **COMMAREA**, BMS maps, KSDS files, temporary-storage queues, the SQLCA, and embedded SQL) is assumed. Where Bricks deviates from the IBM behaviour the difference is documented explicitly.

### Conventions used in this publication

The following notational conventions appear throughout the manual.

| Symbol | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `UPPERCASE` | A keyword. Coded literally. |
| `lowercase` | A value supplied by the programmer (a name or expression). |
| `[ ]` | An optional clause. |
| `{ a | b }` | A required choice between alternatives. |
| `...` | The preceding clause may repeat. |

Command syntax is shown in the `EXEC CICS … END-EXEC` form. The bare-string form (`"VERB OPTIONS"` under `ADDRESS CICS`, REXX only) is described in *Chapter 2. The EXEC CICS command environment*; both forms dispatch identically.

### Reference layout

Each command described in this manual follows the same five-section layout, in this order:

1. **Format** — the command syntax as a code block.
2. **Description** — what the command does and any important runtime behaviour.
3. **Options** — every keyword that follows the verb, with its meaning and any value constraints.
4. **Conditions** — the `EIBRESP` values (or `SQLCODE` values, for `EXEC SQL`) the command may return, together with the cause of each.
5. **Example** — a short, runnable fragment illustrating typical use.

> **Programming Note.** Where the same verb behaves differently in COBOL and in REXX, the difference is called out in a *Programming Note* like this one. Where both languages share identical behaviour, the example uses whichever form reads most clearly.

# Part 1. The bricks programming model

## Chapter 1. Overview

A bricks **transaction** is a 4-character TRANSID listed in
`runtime/transactions.conf`. Each transaction names a **program** —
either a REXX source file in `runtime/rexx/` or a COBOL source file in
`runtime/cobol/` — and an optional access-control list:

```
HELO:rexx:hello.rexx
HELP:rexx:help.rexx:public
QAGE:rexx:qage.rexx:public,users,admin
HELC:cobol:hello.cob:public
GUST:cobol:gust.cob:public
```

A program that runs `EXEC SQL` against something other than the
**first** database in `runtime/databases.conf` adds an explicit
binding as the 5th colon-separated field:

```
BANK:cobol:bank.cob:public,users,admin:bank
```

See *Database binding* in
[Chapter 26](#chapter-26-embedded-sql-cobol-and-rexx) for the full
contract; the short version is that an absent 5th field defaults to
the first row of `databases.conf` and a misbinding manifests as
`SQLCODE = -204` (relation does not exist) on every dispatch.

### Organising programs into sub-directories

Once a deployment grows past a handful of programs, the flat
`runtime/rexx/` / `runtime/cobol/` layout becomes hard to scan. You
can group programs into sub-directories at any depth and reference
them with a relative path from the language root:

```
runtime/cobol/billing/invoice.cob
runtime/cobol/billing/statement.cob
runtime/cobol/cards/visa/authz.cob
runtime/rexx/admin/userprov.rexx
```

```
INVC:cobol:billing/invoice.cob:public
STMT:cobol:billing/statement.cob:public
AUTH:cobol:cards/visa/authz.cob:admin
USRP:rexx:admin/userprov.rexx:admin
```

Forward slashes work on both POSIX and Windows. `CEDA PROGRAM` walks
the language roots recursively and shows each file with its
relative path (so `billing/invoice.cob` appears in the **FILE**
column, matching what you write in `transactions.conf`). `CEMT
INQUIRE TRANSACTION` shows the same form in the **PROGRAM** column,
eliding a long middle (`billing/.../authz.cob`) so the leading
application and the file basename always stay visible. Hidden
entries (dotfile-prefixed, e.g. `.git/`, `.swp` files) are skipped
during the catalogue walk; recursion is capped at 8 levels.

`CEDA TRANSACTION` accepts a relative subdirectory path in the
**PROGRAM** form field. `..` traversal is rejected; so are empty
path segments (`a//b.rexx`). Absolute POSIX paths are accepted
unchanged for the rare case of running one-off programs from
outside the runtime tree. A path containing a `:`, a newline or a
whitespace-preceded ` #` is **refused** — including a
Windows-style `C:\app\prog.cob`, whose drive colon used to write
a `transactions.conf` line the parser read back as a different
record, shifting the groups and database fields one slot to the
right and leaving the transaction unloadable, unreachable, and
bound to a nonexistent database.

`brickscompile` accepts either a single file or a directory. In
directory mode it walks recursively (same depth cap + hidden-skip
rules as `CEDA PROGRAM`) and reports per-file pass/fail; exit code
is `0` only if every file parses cleanly.

### Program caching

The first time a TRANSID is dispatched, its program is parsed and the
AST is cached (see *Parsed-program cache* in the README); subsequent
dispatches skip the parse. Each running task has its own heap and
stack — there is no shared mutable state between concurrently running
tasks of the same TRANSID.

Programs interact with three layers:

1. **The 3270 terminal**, through `EXEC CICS SEND MAP` /
   `RECEIVE MAP` (and the unstructured `SEND TEXT` / `RECEIVE`
   pairing). Maps are defined in the BMS-style DSL described in
   [Chapter 3](#chapter-3-the-map-dsl).
2. **Persistent data**, through KSDS file commands
   ([Chapter 7](#chapter-7-ksds-file-commands)) and TS-queue commands
   ([Chapter 9](#chapter-9-temporary-storage-commands)). Both are
   backed by an embedded bbolt B+tree at `data/files.boltdb`.
3. **Other programs**, through `LINK` (synchronous, with COMMAREA),
   `XCTL` (transfer of control, no return), and `RETURN TRANSID`
   (pseudo-conversational chaining). The Execute Interface Block (EIB)
   exposes session and request state ([Chapter 11](#chapter-11-the-execute-interface-block-eib)).

REXX and COBOL share **the same `EXEC CICS` dispatcher**
(`cics/handler.go`). Every command documented in
[Part 2](#part-2-exec-cics-command-reference) is therefore available,
with identical syntax and identical semantics, from either language.

A typical pseudo-conversational task has the shape:

```rexx
ADDRESS CICS

EXEC CICS RECEIVE MAP('CUST1')              END-EXEC   /* read prior screen */
... validate / compute ...
EXEC CICS SEND    MAP('CUST1') FROM(SCR.) ERASE END-EXEC
EXEC CICS RETURN  TRANSID('CUST')           END-EXEC   /* chain back to self */
```

The dispatcher invokes the program once per ENTER. State that must
survive between invocations rides in the COMMAREA on `RETURN`; the
chained task receives it through `EIBCALEN` and the `DFHCOMMAREA`
data area.

---

## Chapter 2. The EXEC CICS command environment

### Surface forms

Bricks accepts two equivalent surface forms inside an `ADDRESS CICS`
scope.

**1. IBM-canonical `EXEC CICS … END-EXEC`** — the form CICS
programmers recognize. Available from REXX and COBOL.

```rexx
ADDRESS CICS

EXEC CICS ASSIGN  USERID(USR) TERMID(TRM)        END-EXEC
EXEC CICS SEND    MAP('HELO1') FROM(SCR.) ERASE  END-EXEC
EXEC CICS RETURN                                  END-EXEC
```

In REXX, a small preprocessor (`rexx/preprocess.go`, called from
`rexx.Parse`) rewrites each `EXEC CICS … END-EXEC` block into the
equivalent quoted-string command before lexing. Multi-line bodies are
collapsed into a single command string; trailing newlines preserve
source line numbers in error messages. Comments and string literals
are left alone.

In COBOL, the parser collects every token between `EXEC CICS` and
`END-EXEC` and reconstructs the body verbatim for the same
`cics.ParseCommand` REXX uses.

**2. Bare string under `ADDRESS CICS`** — terser; available **only in
REXX**.

```rexx
ADDRESS CICS
"ASSIGN USERID(USR) TERMID(TRM)"
"SEND MAP('HELO1') FROM(SCR.) ERASE"
"RETURN"
```

Both forms route through `cics.ParseCommand` and dispatch to the same
handler. After every command the handler writes `EIBRESP`,
`EIBRESP2`, and `RC` into the program's frame.

### Argument-passing rules

Inside the parentheses of an option:

* A bare identifier is treated as a **variable name**. The handler
  reads the value at runtime, and (where the option is an output)
  writes the result back into that variable.
* A quoted string literal (`'...'` or `"..."`) is treated as a
  **literal value**. The handler does not write to literals; passing
  a literal to an output-only option is rejected with `INVREQ`.

This distinction matters most for length and key fields: `LENGTH(LEN)`
both reads the requested length on input and writes the actual length
back; `LENGTH(80)` only sets the input length.

### Programming model summary

| Concept | Bricks implementation |
|---|---|
| Task | One invocation of one TRANSID (`session.TxCB`). |
| Program | A parsed REXX or COBOL source file, cached at L1/L2. |
| Pseudo-conversational chain | `EXEC CICS RETURN TRANSID(t) COMMAREA(d)`. |
| Conversational | Loop in the program; each `RECEIVE MAP` blocks on input. |
| Inter-program call | `LINK PROGRAM(name) COMMAREA(var)` (synchronous). |
| Storage shared across tasks | KSDS files, TS queues. |
| Storage shared within one task | REXX variables / COBOL WORKING-STORAGE only. |
| Implicit task end | Program runs off the end, or `STOP RUN` (COBOL). |
| Forced task end | `EXEC CICS ABEND`. |

### Response-code handling (`RESP`, `RESP2`, `DFHRESP`)

Every EXEC CICS verb accepts the IBM-canonical `RESP(var)` and
`RESP2(var)` clauses. After dispatch the runtime writes the
numeric response into the named host variables, in addition to
the always-set `EIBRESP` / `EIBRESP2` frame fields. Programs may
therefore write either style:

```cobol
EXEC CICS READ FILE('CUST') INTO(REC) RIDFLD(KEY)
                            RESP(WS-RC) END-EXEC.
IF WS-RC = DFHRESP(NORMAL)   PERFORM USE-REC.
IF WS-RC = DFHRESP(NOTFND)   PERFORM CREATE-REC.

EXEC CICS WRITE FILE('LOG') FROM(BUF) RIDFLD(KEY) END-EXEC.
IF EIBRESP = DFHRESP(DUPREC) PERFORM HANDLE-DUP.
```

`DFHRESP(NAME)` is a compile-time function: the COBOL parser
resolves it to the numeric constant from
`runtime/cobolcopy/DFHRESP.cpy` (and from the matching table in
`cobol/parser.go`). An unknown name is a parse-time error with a
"see DFHRESP.cpy for the list" hint.

### Length as an input bound

`LENGTH(n)` on `READQ TS`, `RECEIVE INTO`, `LINK COMMAREA`, and
`RETURN COMMAREA` is treated as IBM's in/out parameter — the
caller's value caps the bytes returned (or passed forward, for
LINK/RETURN); the post-dispatch write-back stores the actual byte
count. A `LENGTH(80)` on `READQ TS` against a 200-byte item now
hands the program 80 bytes and reports `80`, matching real CICS
instead of overflowing the buffer.

On `READ FILE`, `READNEXT`, and `READPREV` (file-record family),
LENGTH is OUTPUT-only — the store decides record size; there is no
operator-supplied truncation bound. This is a bricks-defensible
simplification for the KSDS-fixed-length model; real VSAM
variable-length permits LENGTH-as-max-buffer. The write-back-then-
read-as-input pattern (call 1 writes len(rec1) into LEN, call 2
re-reads LEN as a cap) would silently corrupt subsequent reads, so
bricks ignores the input value entirely on these verbs.

---

## Chapter 3. The map DSL

Bricks ships its own line-oriented, BMS-flavoured map DSL (parsed by
`mapdsl/`). Maps live as `*.map` files in the directory configured by
`maps_dir` (default `runtime/map/`). Each file contains one or more
`MAP … ENDMAP` blocks. Comments start with `*`.

### Format

```
[MAPSET <name>]                           -- optional, namespace for the file
MAP <name> SIZE rowsxcols
  [FIELD AT r,c LEN n <attrs> "literal"]
  [INPUT <fieldname> AT r,c LEN n <attrs> [DEFAULT "value"]]
  [STOP AT r,c]
  [CURSOR AT {fieldname | r,c}]
ENDMAP
[MAP <name> SIZE rowsxcols                -- multiple MAP blocks per file
   ...
ENDMAP]
```

### Statements

**`MAPSET <name>`** *(optional, must be the first non-comment line)*
   Names the mapset — the namespace every `MAP` block in this file
   belongs to. The catalog uses `MAPSET.NAME` as its key so two
   different files can declare a map named `MAPA` without
   colliding. When the line is omitted, the mapset defaults to the
   file's basename (uppercased, extension stripped): a file named
   `help1.map` has implicit mapset `HELP1`.

**`MAP <name> SIZE rowsxcols`**
   The map header. Names must be unique **within their mapset**
   (case-insensitive); typical sizes are `24x80` (mod 2) and
   `43x80` (mod 4). A single `.map` file may declare any number
   of MAP blocks back-to-back — useful when porting a BMS mapset
   that contained several DFHMDI macros under one DFHMSD.

**`FIELD AT r,c LEN n <attrs> "literal"`**
   A display-only field that paints the literal at row `r`, column
   `c`, length `n`. Useful for labels, headings, and panel chrome.

**`INPUT <fieldname> AT r,c LEN n <attrs> [DEFAULT "value"]`**
   A named input field. The name is how `SEND MAP FROM(STEM.)` and
   `RECEIVE MAP INTO(STEM.)` route data to / from this position
   (`STEM.<fieldname>`). Use `PROT` to make the field
   write-protected but still named — useful for output values painted
   by `SEND MAP FROM(STEM.)`.

**`STOP AT r,c`**
   An autoskip stop attribute that ends the preceding input field.

**`CURSOR AT <fieldname>`** *or* **`CURSOR AT r,c`**
   The home position for the cursor when the map is sent. The named
   form resolves to `(field.Row, field.Col + 1)` — i.e. one byte to
   the right of the leading 3270 attribute byte, which is the
   writable cell. Forward references are allowed; names are resolved
   after the whole map is parsed. When omitted, the renderer falls
   back to the first input field.

**`ENDMAP`**
   Terminates the map.

### Converting legacy BMS sources

The `bricksconvert` CLI utility (under `cmd/bricksconvert`)
converts IBM CICS **BMS map source** (`DFHMSD` / `DFHMDI` /
`DFHMDF` macros) into this DSL — the recommended path for
porting an existing CICS application's screens onto bricks
without rewriting every panel by hand. See the
[BMS conversion section in the README](README.md#bms-conversion--bricksconvert)
for usage details.

### Attributes

`PROT`, `UNPROT`, `BRIGHT`, `DIM`, `UNDERLINE`, `HIDDEN`, `NUMERIC`,
`MDT`, `BLINK`, `REVERSE`, `COLOR=BLUE|RED|PINK|GREEN|TURQUOISE|YELLOW|WHITE`.

`UNDERLINE` is the canonical IBM BMS spelling (`HILIGHT=UNDERLINE`).
`UNDERSCORE` is accepted as a legacy alias for hand-written bricks DSL
maps that already use it; new maps should prefer `UNDERLINE`.

### Catalogue lifecycle

`mapdsl.NewCatalog(dir)` parses every `*.map` file at startup and
self-refreshes on subsequent edits. Each `Lookup(name)` stats the
directory plus the source file backing the requested name; on `mtime`
change the directory is reparsed and swapped atomically. A failed
re-parse keeps the prior catalogue in place — the operator can find
the broken file with `CEMT PERFORM RESCAN MAP` (see the README).

### Sending a map by mapset

`EXEC CICS SEND MAP('NAME') MAPSET('SET') FROM(stem)` resolves
through the qualified `MAPSET.NAME` index, so:

```cobol
EXEC CICS SEND MAP('MAPA') MAPSET('AM01') FROM(AM01) ERASE END-EXEC.
EXEC CICS SEND MAP('MAPA') MAPSET('AM16') FROM(AP16) ERASE END-EXEC.
EXEC CICS SEND MAP('MAPB') MAPSET('AM99') FROM(AM99) ERASE END-EXEC.
```

each picks the right map even when several files share the same
bare map name. When `MAPSET(...)` is omitted, the catalog tries a
bare-name lookup; if that name appears in more than one mapset the
runtime returns the short diagnostic
`SEND MAP: map "MAPA" is ambiguous; specify MAPSET` rather than
silently picking one. Programs that only ever reference unique
bare names (the typical case for the runtime/map shipped with
bricks) keep working without any code change.

`RECEIVE MAP` accepts the same `MAPSET(...)` clause with identical
resolution semantics.

### Example

```
* CICS sign-on screen
MAP CSSN SIZE 24x80
  FIELD AT 1,28 LEN 24 PROT BRIGHT COLOR=TURQUOISE  "BRICKS SIGN-ON"
  FIELD AT 6,15 LEN 9  PROT                         "Userid:"
  INPUT USERID   AT 6,25 LEN 8 UNDERSCORE COLOR=GREEN
  STOP           AT 6,34
  FIELD AT 8,15 LEN 9  PROT                         "Password:"
  INPUT PASSWORD AT 8,25 LEN 8 HIDDEN UNDERSCORE COLOR=RED
  STOP           AT 8,34
  CURSOR         AT USERID
ENDMAP
```

## Chapter 4. Terminal I/O commands

### SEND MAP

Send a BMS-style map to the 3270 terminal and wait for the operator
to press an AID key.

#### Format

```
EXEC CICS SEND MAP(name)
              [MAPSET(set)] [FROM(stem.)]
              [ERASE | ERASEAUP | DATAONLY] [MAPONLY]
              [CURSOR(position)]
              [FREEKB] [ALARM] [FRSET]
              [RESP(var)] [RESP2(var)]
END-EXEC
```

#### Description

Loads the named map from the catalogue, populates each named field
with the value of `<stem>.<fieldname>` (when `FROM` is supplied),
paints the screen, and waits for the operator to press an AID key
(ENTER, PFn, PAn, CLEAR). On return, the captured response is stored
on the TCB so a subsequent `RECEIVE MAP` can pull modified field
values back into the program. `EIBAID` and `EIBCPOSN` are updated
with the AID character and 1-based cursor position.

IBM-canonical clauses honoured: `MAPSET(set)` qualifies the lookup
to disambiguate same-named maps across mapsets (see Chapter 3);
`ERASEAUP` wipes unprotected fields only (approximated as `ERASE`
in bricks); `MAPONLY` paints just the map's literals + INPUT
defaults, ignoring any `FROM(stem.)`. `FREEKB`, `ALARM`, and
`FRSET` are accepted for source compatibility — `FREEKB` and
`FRSET` are subsumed by the fixed WCC the go3270 library writes;
`ALARM` is parsed but not yet tunnelled to the wire.

If `FROM` is omitted, the map renders using its `INPUT DEFAULT`
values. If `FROM` is a literal string, every named field on the map
is filled with that literal (rare; supported for parity with BMS).

##### Three paint modes

| Flag | Field set | Blocking? | When to use |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ERASE` | Every field in the map | Yes — waits for AID | Initial paint, full refresh. |
| (neither) | Only fields the program populated in `FROM(stem)` | Yes — waits for AID | In-place update inside a conversational loop (rare; usually `ERASE` is fine). |
| `DATAONLY` | Only fields the program populated in `FROM(stem)` | **No — returns immediately** | Background refresh while a different task is mid-input. |

`ERASE` clears the screen first and emits **every** field in the
map (with either the program's `FROM` value or the map default).
Without `ERASE`, bricks does a **partial repaint**: only fields the
program explicitly populated in `FROM(stem)` are sent; fields the
program didn't touch stay on the terminal exactly as the operator
left them. Use `ERASE` for the initial paint of a screen or a full
refresh; omit it for in-place partial updates.

##### `DATAONLY` — background partial paint

`DATAONLY` is the bricks idiom for **background, fire-and-forget
partial paint**, used to refresh part of the screen — typically a
clock or other status fields — while a different task on the same
terminal is blocking inside `SEND MAP` waiting for the operator's
next keystroke. It layers two things on top of the plain no-`ERASE`
partial-paint behaviour:

1. **No-block:** `DATAONLY` makes `SEND MAP` return immediately
   after writing the screen, without entering the AID-wait. The
   call is fire-and-forget — the operator's next AID is captured
   by whatever other `SEND MAP` or `RECEIVE MAP` happens to be
   blocking for it.
2. **Scheduler-safe:** when an `EXEC CICS START INTERVAL(...)`
   timer fires on a terminal whose current task is in input-wait,
   the bricks scheduler dispatches the queued task **inline** in
   the timer goroutine instead of poisoning the conn read deadline
   (which would abend the in-flight task with an `i/o timeout`).
   The inline-dispatched task is restricted to write-only verbs:
   `SEND MAP DATAONLY`, file I/O, TS queue, ASSIGN, START. Any
   blocking verb (`RECEIVE MAP`, `SEND MAP` without DATAONLY,
   `CONVERSE`) returns `INVREQ` in that context — the scheduler
   goroutine must not block on conn.Read.

This together lets a transaction self-schedule a periodic refresh
via:

```rexx
EXEC CICS START TRANSID('CHAT') INTERVAL(000002) FROM('TICK') END-EXEC
EXEC CICS RETURN END-EXEC
```

When the START fires, the same transaction is dispatched a second
time. The dispatched copy detects "I am a tick" by checking the
`RETRIEVE` payload, paints only the fields it wants to refresh
(`SEND MAP ... DATAONLY` — the operator's input field is not in
the populated set, so it's never repainted), schedules the next
tick, and returns. The main task on the same terminal stays
blocked in its outer `SEND MAP` throughout. See
`runtime/rexx/chat.rexx` for the worked example.

`DATAONLY` and `ERASE` are mutually exclusive — the runtime
rejects the combination at parse time. Note: bricks does not
implement the real-CICS `DATAONLY` attribute-byte semantics
(application-supplied attribute bytes via `X'00'` sentinels);
programs that need a synchronous partial repaint use the plain
no-`ERASE` form, and programs that need a background refresh
use `DATAONLY` with the START-INTERVAL pattern above.

#### Options

**MAP(name)** *— required*
   Name of a map in the catalogue (case-insensitive). MAPFAIL if
   absent.

**FROM(stem.)**
   Stem variable whose tails name the map's input fields. The stem's
   trailing dot is optional: `FROM(SCR)` and `FROM(SCR.)` are
   equivalent.

**ERASE**
   Clears the screen before painting AND emits every field in the
   map. Without this flag, only fields the program populated in
   `FROM(stem)` are sent — fields the program didn't touch stay
   on the terminal unchanged (partial repaint).

**DATAONLY**
   Fire-and-forget partial paint: SEND returns immediately without
   waiting for an AID. Implies no-ERASE partial-repaint semantics.
   Mutually exclusive with `ERASE`.

**CURSOR(position)**
   1-based cursor position. Overrides the map's `CURSOR AT` clause.

#### Conditions

| Condition | EIBRESP | Cause |
|---|---:|---|
| NORMAL | 0 | Map sent, AID received. |
| MAPFAIL | 36 | Named map not found in the catalogue. |
| IOERR | 17 | The terminal write failed. |

#### Example

```rexx
SCR.GREETING = 'Hello, ' || USR
EXEC CICS SEND MAP('HELO1') FROM(SCR.) ERASE END-EXEC
```

#### Runtime field attribute overrides

A map's `COLOR=` clause is the *default* colour for each field. Programs
can override the colour of any named field at runtime by setting a
sibling element named `<FIELD>-C` in COBOL or `<stem>.<FIELD>_C` in
REXX, before the `SEND MAP`. The override wins; an empty / unset value
means "use map default."

**COBOL**

```cobol
COPY DFHCOLOR.
01 SCR.
   05 STATUS    PIC X(10).
   05 STATUS-C  PIC X(9) VALUE SPACES.
...
IF BALANCE < 0
    MOVE DFHRED   TO STATUS-C
ELSE
    MOVE DFHGREEN TO STATUS-C
END-IF.
EXEC CICS SEND MAP('BALC') FROM(SCR) ERASE END-EXEC.
```

**REXX**

```rexx
if balance < 0 then scr.status_c = 'RED'
               else scr.status_c = 'GREEN'
'EXEC CICS SEND MAP(BALC) FROM(SCR.) ERASE'
```

Accepted colour mnemonics: `BLUE RED PINK GREEN TURQUOISE YELLOW
NEUTRAL DEFAULT` (also the `DFH`-prefixed canonical names from
`DFHCOLOR.cpy`: `DFHBLUE DFHRED DFHPINK DFHGREEN DFHTURQ DFHYELLO
DFHNEUTR DFHDFT`). Unknown strings degrade to the device default.

**REXX symbol caveat.** REXX evaluates stem tails by value, not
literal: if your program has assigned a bare variable `STATUS_C`
anywhere, then `scr.status_c = 'RED'` binds to the value of
`STATUS_C`, not the literal tail `STATUS_C`. Defensive form is
`scr.'STATUS_C' = 'RED'` (quoted tail).

Highlight (`-H`) and attribute byte (`-A`) overrides follow the same
convention and are planned for a follow-up release.

See `runtime/cobol/balc.cob` and `runtime/rexx/balc.rexx` for complete
worked examples.

### RECEIVE MAP

Retrieve the operator's input from the most recent `SEND MAP`.

#### Format

```
EXEC CICS RECEIVE MAP(name)
                  [INTO(stem.)]
END-EXEC
```

#### Description

Pulls the response stored by the most recent `SEND MAP` into a stem,
one tail per named field on the map (`<stem>.<fieldname>`). When
`INTO` is omitted, the default stem is `MAP.`.

A `RECEIVE MAP` with no matching prior `SEND MAP` returns `MAPFAIL`.

#### Options

**MAP(name)** *— required*
   The same map name passed to the prior `SEND MAP`.

**INTO(stem.)**
   Destination stem. Default `MAP.`.

#### Conditions

| Condition | EIBRESP | Cause |
|---|---:|---|
| NORMAL | 0 | Fields retrieved. |
| MAPFAIL | 36 | No prior matching `SEND MAP`, or named map not found. |

#### Example

```rexx
EXEC CICS RECEIVE MAP('CUST1') INTO(IN.) END-EXEC
ACTION = IN.ACTION
CKEY   = IN.CUSTNO
```

---

### CONVERSE

A single verb that fuses `SEND MAP` and `RECEIVE MAP` against the
same map. Semantically identical to issuing the two halves
back-to-back; provided because real-world CICS programs written
between the 1970s and the 1990s used `CONVERSE` heavily, and
porting them shouldn't require a SEND/RECEIVE rewrite.

#### Format

CONVERSE has two IBM-canonical forms — the 3270 mapped form and
the raw-text TS form. Bricks supports both.

**Mapped form (3270):**

```
EXEC CICS CONVERSE MAP(name) [MAPSET(set)]
                   [FROM(area) | FROMMAP(area)]
                   [INTO(area)]
                   [ERASE] [CURSOR(pos)]
                   [RESP(var)] [RESP2(var)]
END-EXEC
```

**Text form (TS):**

```
EXEC CICS CONVERSE FROM(area) [FROMLENGTH(n)]
                   INTO(target) [TOLENGTH(var) | MAXLENGTH(n)]
                   [STRFIELD] [DEFRESP]
                   [RESP(var)] [RESP2(var)]
END-EXEC
```

In the mapped form: `FROM(area)` and `FROMMAP(area)` are accepted
spellings for the outbound stem; either works, both feed the SEND
half. `INTO(area)` is the inbound stem; it feeds the RECEIVE
half. `MAPSET`, `ERASE`, `CURSOR` pass through to both halves.

In the text form (no `MAP`): bricks dispatches `SEND TEXT` then
`RECEIVE INTO`. `FROMLENGTH(n)` caps the outbound bytes;
`TOLENGTH(var)` / `MAXLENGTH(n)` cap the inbound buffer.
`STRFIELD` (structured-field stream) and `DEFRESP` (definite-
response) are accepted silently — bricks doesn't tunnel either
wire bit today but program source ports cleanly.

#### Behaviour

CONVERSE issues `SEND MAP` first, then `RECEIVE MAP` against the
same `MAP(name)`. If the SEND half returns anything other than
`RESP-NORMAL`, the RECEIVE half is **skipped** and the SEND's
response code is returned — matches real CICS semantics (no
screen ever made it to the terminal, so there's no operator
response to wait for).

#### Example

```cobol
EXEC CICS CONVERSE MAP('TIM1') FROM(SCR) INTO(SCR)
                   ERASE
END-EXEC.
IF EIBAID = PF03 THEN
    EXEC CICS RETURN END-EXEC
END-IF.
```

This replaces the longer pair:

```cobol
EXEC CICS SEND MAP('TIM1') FROM(SCR) ERASE END-EXEC.
EXEC CICS RECEIVE MAP('TIM1') INTO(SCR)     END-EXEC.
```

Live example: `runtime/cobol/timc.cob` uses CONVERSE for both the
input screen and the reminder screen.

---

### SEND TEXT

Free-form text output without a BMS map.

#### Format

```
EXEC CICS SEND TEXT FROM(area)
                    [LENGTH(n)]
                    [ERASE]
END-EXEC
```

#### Description

Real-CICS `SEND TEXT`. The body is treated as a flat row-major
buffer: every `cols` bytes (default 80) lands on the next row,
starting at row 0. **3270 has no LF/CR**, so programs must pad each
logical line to the column width and concatenate (REXX
`LEFT(s,80)`, COBOL `PIC X(80)` group children).

`LENGTH(n)` truncates the body to `n` bytes; bytes past `rows*cols`
are dropped. `ERASE` clears the screen before painting; without it,
existing fields stay behind. Like `SEND MAP`, the call paints
synchronously and waits for an AID, so the operator has time to read
the screen before `RETURN`.

Works identically from REXX and COBOL.

#### Options

**FROM(area)** *— required*
   The buffer to paint. Can be a REXX variable or a COBOL group item.

**LENGTH(n)**
   Truncate the body to this length.

**ERASE**
   Clear the screen first.

#### Conditions

| Condition | EIBRESP | Cause |
|---|---:|---|
| NORMAL | 0 | Body painted, AID received. |
| INVREQ | 16 | `FROM` missing. |
| IOERR | 17 | The terminal write failed. |

#### Example

See [Chapter 29. Worked examples](#chapter-29-worked-examples), the
`GETC` program, for the canonical multi-row `SEND TEXT` pattern.

---

### RECEIVE

Retrieve the unedited terminal line typed by the operator at the
blank prompt — typically used to pick up command-line arguments.

#### Format

```
EXEC CICS RECEIVE INTO(buffer)
                  [LENGTH(len)]
END-EXEC
```

#### Description

Returns the unedited terminal line the operator typed at the blank
prompt (TRANSID prefix included), e.g. `EXAM 1 2 3`. Single-shot
per task: a second `RECEIVE` in the same task, or any `RECEIVE` in a
chained `RETURN TRANSID` task, returns `EOC` (RESP=6).

When `LENGTH(var)` is a bare variable, the actual byte count of the
line is written back. The receiving COBOL field's `PIC X(n)` width
handles padding/truncation via standard `MOVE` semantics; programs
detect truncation by comparing `len` against `n`.

#### Options

**INTO(buffer)** *— required*
   Destination variable for the line.

**LENGTH(len)**
   When a bare variable, receives the actual length on return.

#### Conditions

| Condition | EIBRESP | Cause |
|---|---:|---|
| NORMAL | 0 | Line returned. |
| EOC | 6 | No input available (already consumed in this task chain). |

#### Example

```rexx
EXEC CICS RECEIVE INTO(BUF) LENGTH(LEN) END-EXEC   /* "GETC 100" */
PARSE VAR BUF TID CKEY .
```

```cobol
EXEC CICS RECEIVE INTO(WS-INPUT) LENGTH(WS-LEN) END-EXEC
UNSTRING WS-INPUT DELIMITED BY ' '
   INTO WS-TID WS-A WS-B WS-C
END-UNSTRING.
```

---

## Chapter 5. Program control commands

### RETURN

End the current task; optionally chain to another TRANSID with a
COMMAREA.

#### Format

```
EXEC CICS RETURN [TRANSID(id)]
                 [COMMAREA(data)]
END-EXEC
```

#### Description

Sets `tcb.NextTransid` and `tcb.Commarea` and ends the task. With no
`TRANSID`, control falls back to the blank prompt. With a `TRANSID`,
the dispatcher invokes that TRANSID next, with the supplied
`COMMAREA` available to the new task as `DFHCOMMAREA` and its length
as `EIBCALEN`.

> **COBOL program termination & the end-of-task syncpoint.**
> `EXEC CICS RETURN` is the canonical way a CICS program ends, and the only
> one that carries the pseudo-conversational `TRANSID` / `COMMAREA` handoff.
> `STOP RUN`, `GOBACK`, `EXIT PROGRAM`, and running off the end of the
> PROCEDURE DIVISION also end the task cleanly (bricks tolerates them
> LE-style), and bricks runs the **implicit end-of-task syncpoint** — which
> commits the task's `EXEC SQL` unit of work — for those paths too, so a
> program that mutates SQL and then `STOP RUN`s does **not** lose the update.
> `STOP RUN` is nonetheless the CICS anti-pattern: it carries no
> pseudo-conversational handoff and, in a CALLed sub-program, would terminate
> the whole run unit. Use `EXEC CICS RETURN` in CICS code (with `GOBACK`, not
> `STOP RUN`, as the unreachable post-`RETURN` terminator the compiler wants).

#### Options

**TRANSID(id)**
   The next TRANSID to dispatch.

**COMMAREA(data)**
   Bytes to flow into the next task.

#### Conditions

| Condition | EIBRESP | Cause |
|---|---:|---|
| NORMAL | 0 | Task ended. |

#### Example

```rexx
EXEC CICS RETURN TRANSID('CUST') COMMAREA(SAVEAREA) END-EXEC
```

---

### XCTL

Transfer control to another program. The current program does not
resume.

#### Format

```
EXEC CICS XCTL PROGRAM(name)
              [COMMAREA(data) [LENGTH(n)]]
              [RESP(var)] [RESP2(var)]
END-EXEC
```

`LENGTH(n)` on `COMMAREA` is the IBM-canonical input bound —
caller's value caps the bytes passed to the receiving program.
`CHANNEL(...)` (the CICS-TS container alternative to COMMAREA) is
rejected with a short "not supported in bricks (use COMMAREA)"
message — single-region bricks doesn't model channels.

#### Description

Transfer of control. The named program runs in place of the current
one; the COMMAREA, if supplied, becomes its `DFHCOMMAREA`. The
current task's chain continues with the new program; `RETURN
TRANSID` semantics carry through unchanged.

#### Options

**PROGRAM(name)** *— required*
   The target program. Resolved through `runtime/transactions.conf`.

**COMMAREA(data)**
   Bytes to flow to the target.

#### Conditions

| Condition | EIBRESP | Cause |
|---|---:|---|
| NORMAL | 0 | Control transferred. |
| PGMIDERR | 27 | Target program not in `transactions.conf`. |
| INVREQ | 16 | `PROGRAM` missing. |

#### Example

```rexx
EXEC CICS XCTL PROGRAM('VALIDATE') COMMAREA(SCR) END-EXEC
```

---

### LINK

Synchronously call a sub-program with bidirectional COMMAREA.

#### Format

```
EXEC CICS LINK PROGRAM(name)
              [COMMAREA(var | 'literal')]
END-EXEC
```

#### Description

The target program runs in a fresh frame with its `DFHCOMMAREA`
preloaded from the caller's `COMMAREA(var)` (or literal). When the
sub-program exits, its final `DFHCOMMAREA` is written back to the
caller's variable.

Caller state — `NextTransid`, `Commarea`, `LastResponse`,
`LastMapName` — is saved before the LINK and restored on return, so
the LINK is transparent to the caller's pseudo-conversational
context.

The per-transaction ACL is rechecked on the target so a low-privilege
caller cannot escalate by linking into an admin program.

REXX and COBOL programs can LINK to each other freely; `DFHCOMMAREA`
is marshalled as opaque bytes.

#### Options

**PROGRAM(name)** *— required*
   The sub-program to call. Resolved through
   `runtime/transactions.conf`.

**COMMAREA(var | 'literal')**
   Bidirectional data area. A bare variable is read on entry and
   written on exit; a literal is read-only.

#### Conditions

| Condition | EIBRESP | Cause |
|---|---:|---|
| NORMAL | 0 | Sub-program returned cleanly. |
| PGMIDERR | 27 | Target not in `transactions.conf`, sub-program errored, or the caller is not authorised for the target. |

#### Example

```rexx
SAV = ''                                /* working area */
EXEC CICS LINK PROGRAM('CUSV') COMMAREA(SAV) END-EXEC
IF EIBRESP <> 0 THEN SIGNAL ERR
PARSE VAR SAV STATUS '|' MSG
```

---

### ABEND

Abnormally terminate the current task.

#### Format

```
EXEC CICS ABEND [ABCODE(code)]
                [NODUMP] [CANCEL]
                [RESP(var)] [RESP2(var)]
END-EXEC
```

`CANCEL` bypasses any installed `HANDLE ABEND` trap — the task
terminates rather than recovering. `NODUMP` is accepted silently
(bricks has no dump facility).

#### Description

Ends the task with the supplied 4-character abend code (default
`AAAA`). Bricks logs the abend on the operator console and reflects
it in the `TxCB`'s status; pseudo-conversational chains are broken
(no `NextTransid` is honoured after an `ABEND`).

#### Options

**ABCODE(code)**
   4-character code to record. Defaults to `AAAA`.

**NODUMP**
   Accepted for parity with IBM CICS; no dumps are produced anyway.

#### Conditions

`ABEND` does not return; nothing follows it in the program flow.

#### Example

```rexx
IF EIBRESP <> 0 THEN
   EXEC CICS ABEND ABCODE('FIO1') END-EXEC
```

---

### START

Schedule a transaction to fire on this same terminal after a
delay (or at a wall-clock time), optionally passing a byte
payload the new task picks up via `RETRIEVE`. This is bricks's
implementation of CICS's classic deferred-work pattern: a task
queues "do X in 60 seconds" and ends; the terminal returns to
the blank prompt; when the timer elapses, bricks dispatches X
automatically.

#### Format

```
EXEC CICS START TRANSID(name)
                [INTERVAL(hhmmss) | TIME(hhmmss) |
                 AFTER HOURS(h) MINUTES(m) SECONDS(s) MILLISECS(ms) |
                 AT    HOURS(h) MINUTES(m) SECONDS(s) MILLISECS(ms)]
                [FROM(area) [LENGTH(n)]]
                [TERMID(tttt)]
                [REQID(handle)] [PROTECT]
                [RESP(var)] [RESP2(var)]
END-EXEC
```

`REQID(handle)` tags the START with a request-id handle. IBM uses
this to disambiguate when cancelling or deferring; bricks's
single-region scheduler accepts the option without action so
program source ports cleanly. `PROTECT` declares the START as
recoverable — bricks already enrolls every START in the task-end
SYNCPOINT, so this is silent passthrough. `SYSID` and `QUEUE` —
explicitly rejected with a short "not supported" message.

#### Options

**TRANSID(name)** *(required)*
   4-character transaction id, must exist in
   `runtime/transactions.conf`. The dispatcher applies the
   normal per-transaction ACL at fire time, so the operator
   must still be authorised to invoke `name`.

**INTERVAL(hhmmss)**
   Delay before firing, expressed as up to 6 digits in
   `HHMMSS` form (left-padded with zeroes). `INTERVAL(30)` =
   30 s; `INTERVAL(000130)` = 1 min 30 s; `INTERVAL(010000)`
   = 1 h. Omit (or pair with `INTERVAL(0)`) to fire on the
   next prompt-loop iteration.

**TIME(hhmmss)**
   Absolute wall-clock target, also `HHMMSS`. Respects the
   operator's `time_zone=` setting. If the target is earlier
   than now, bricks rolls forward to the same time tomorrow
   (real-CICS semantics). Mutually exclusive with `INTERVAL`.

**AFTER / AT HOURS(h) MINUTES(m) SECONDS(s) MILLISECS(ms)**
   The IBM-canonical compositional alternatives to
   `INTERVAL` / `TIME` — supply any subset of the four
   components. `AFTER` is relative, `AT` is the next
   wall-clock instant with that time-of-day, rolling forward
   to tomorrow when it has already passed (same rule as
   `TIME`). The components are additive **counts**, not clock
   digits, so `AFTER MINUTES(90)` is an hour and a half;
   IBM's ranges are `HOURS` 0–99, `MINUTES` 0–5999,
   `SECONDS` 0–359999 and `MILLISECS` 0–360000000, with an
   `AFTER` total capped at 100 hours and an `AT` total under
   24 hours. `MILLISECS(ms)` is the bricks sub-second
   extension and also works on its own
   (`START TRANSID('X') MILLISECS(100)`); components coded
   with neither `AFTER` nor `AT` are read as `AFTER`.
   Mutually exclusive with `INTERVAL` / `TIME`.

**FROM(area) [LENGTH(n)]**
   Payload bytes the new task will pull back via `RETRIEVE`.
   `LENGTH` truncates `area` to `n` bytes; if omitted, the
   entire string value of `area` is queued. The bytes are
   copied at `START` time, so the issuing task may mutate
   `area` afterwards without disturbing the queued payload.

**TERMID(tttt)**
   Must equal the issuing terminal's `EIBTRMID` in this
   version. Cross-terminal STARTs return `RESP-INVREQ` with
   "only same-terminal STARTs are supported."

#### Scope and limitations (v1)

* **Same-terminal only.** A START always fires on the issuing
  TCB. No-`TERMID` background tasks and `TERMID(other)` are
  rejected; both require infrastructure (synthetic TCBs,
  cross-session authorisation) that's deferred.
* **In-memory queue.** Pending STARTs do **not** survive a
  bricks restart. If you need recovery-protected scheduling
  you'll have to wait for `START PROTECT` (out of scope).
* **No `SYSID` or `QUEUE` options.** Each returns
  `RESP-INVREQ` with the option name in the error string so a
  port can be triaged. (`REQID` is recorded on the queued
  entry and honoured by `CANCEL REQID`; `PROTECT` is accepted
  as a no-op; `HOURS` / `MINUTES` / `SECONDS` / `MILLISECS`
  are implemented — see `AFTER` / `AT` above.)
* **One pending payload per task.** When the START fires,
  the FROM bytes go into `tcb.RetrieveBuf`. The new task's
  first `RETRIEVE` drains it; a second `RETRIEVE` returns
  `RESP-ENDDATA` (29).

#### Conditions

* `RESP-NORMAL` on successful enqueue.
* `RESP-INVREQ` for missing TRANSID, cross-terminal TERMID,
  unsupported option, or malformed INTERVAL/TIME.

#### Example

```cobol
       EXEC CICS START TRANSID('TIMC') INTERVAL('000030')
                       FROM(MSG)
       END-EXEC.
```

Schedules `TIMC` to fire on this terminal in 30 seconds with
the contents of `MSG` queued as the payload. See
`runtime/cobol/timc.cob` and `runtime/rexx/timr.rexx` for the
worked examples.

---

### RETRIEVE

Pull back the `FROM(...)` payload of the `START` that
scheduled the *current* task. RETRIEVE is the receiving half
of the START / RETRIEVE pair; the first thing a transaction
fired by `START` typically does.

#### Format

```
EXEC CICS RETRIEVE INTO(var) [LENGTH(n)]
                  [RESP(var)] [RESP2(var)]
END-EXEC
```

`LENGTH(n)` is the IBM in/out parameter — caller's value caps the
bytes returned, the post-call value is the actual byte count.

#### Options

**INTO(var)** *(required)*
   Variable / DATA area to receive the payload bytes. Must be
   a name reference, not a string literal.

**LENGTH(lenvar)**
   Optional. The variable named here is written with the
   actual byte length of the payload after a successful read,
   so the caller can size the consumer code correctly.

#### Behaviour

* Cold dispatch (operator typed the TRANSID at the prompt) →
  `RESP-ENDDATA` (29), nothing written to `INTO`.
* Scheduled re-entry → `RESP-NORMAL`, payload bytes copied
  into `INTO`, `tcb.RetrieveBuf` cleared.
* Second RETRIEVE in the same task → `RESP-ENDDATA` (the
  buffer is cleared on first read; v1 supports one pending
  payload per task).

#### Idiom

The canonical START / RETRIEVE program tests `EIBRESP` first
to discover *which dispatch path* it's on, then branches:

```cobol
       MOVE SPACES TO BUF.
       EXEC CICS RETRIEVE INTO(BUF) END-EXEC.

       IF EIBRESP = RESP-NORMAL THEN
           PERFORM SHOW-REMINDER       *> scheduled fire
           EXEC CICS RETURN END-EXEC
       END-IF.

       *> Cold path: prompt the operator, schedule next fire.
       PERFORM PROMPT-AND-SCHEDULE.
```

REXX equivalent in `runtime/rexx/timr.rexx`; COBOL in
`runtime/cobol/timc.cob`.

## Chapter 6. System services

### ASSIGN

Read EIB, session, and environment fields into the program.

#### Format

```
EXEC CICS ASSIGN <FIELD>(target) [<FIELD>(target) ...]
END-EXEC
```

#### Description

Reads one or more system fields into program variables. Multiple
options can be combined in a single `ASSIGN` call. Each `<FIELD>` is
one of the keywords below; `target` is the variable that receives
the value.

#### Options

| Option | Returns |
|---|---|
| `USERID(t)` | Signed-on userid (empty until CSSN succeeds). |
| `TERMID(t)` / `EIBTRMID(t)` | Unique 4-digit terminal id (`T0001` …). |
| `EIBAID(t)` | Single-byte AID character of the most recent `SEND MAP` / `RECEIVE MAP`. Compare with `C2X(EIBAID) = 'F3'` (REXX) or `EIBAID = X'F3'` (COBOL) to detect PF3, etc. |
| `EIBCPOSN(t)` | 1-based cursor position from the most recent map response. |
| `EIBCALEN(t)` | Length of `DFHCOMMAREA` flowed in from the caller. |
| `CWALENG(t)` | Byte length of the region Common Work Area — the `wrkarea=` value from `bricks.cnf`. `0` when no CWA is configured. See [EXEC CICS ADDRESS](#address--exec-cics-address). |
| `TWALENG(t)` | Byte length of this task's Transaction Work Area — the `TWASIZE` 6th field of the transaction's `transactions.conf` row. `0` when no TWA is configured. See [EXEC CICS ADDRESS](#address--exec-cics-address). |
| `TCTUALENG(t)` | Always `0` (bricks does not model a TCTUA). |
| `SCREENHT(t)` / `SCREENWD(t)` | Negotiated terminal rows / columns. |
| `ALTSCRNHT(t)` / `ALTSCRNWD(t)` | Same values; bricks does not distinguish primary and alternate sizes. |
| `CONNECTED(t)` / `CONNTIME(t)` | Wall-clock connect timestamp `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS`. |
| `TLS(t)` | `yes` when the session is on the TLS listener, `no` otherwise. |
| `DATE(t)` | Today as `YYYYMMDD`. *(bricks-specific)* |
| `TIME(t)` | Now as `HHMMSS`. *(bricks-specific)* |
| `TODAYYR(t)` / `TODAYMO(t)` / `TODAYDY(t)` | Today's year / month / day individually. *(bricks-specific)* |
| `DAYCOUNT(t)` | Days since `1900-01-01` (the IBM ABSTIME epoch). Subtract two values for an exact day delta. **Behaviour change in round 2:** previously returned Unix-epoch days; bricks now matches real CICS. |
| `SYSID(t)` | Local CICS region ID (`BRKS` in bricks). |
| `APPLID(t)` | Region VTAM applid (`BRICKS01` in bricks). |
| `NETID(t)` | Network ID of the connected terminal (`TCPIP` in bricks; placeholder for a future config knob). |
| `ABCODE(t)` | Most recent abend code (the value `EIBABCODE` carries). Empty before any ABEND. |
| `EIBTASKN(t)` | Numeric task number — the integer body of `TxCB.ID`. |
| `STARTCODE(t)` | How the task was started. `TO` (terminal operator) is the bricks default; future work threads `S` (started by EXEC CICS START) through the scheduler. |

The bricks-specific options exist primarily so the COBOL subset can
do date math without REXX-style intrinsic functions; see
`runtime/cobol/qagc.cob` for an example that computes age in years
from a birthdate.

#### Conditions

| Condition | EIBRESP | Cause |
|---|---:|---|
| NORMAL | 0 | All requested fields returned. |
| INVREQ | 16 | A field name is unknown, or its target is a literal rather than a variable. |

#### Example

```rexx
EXEC CICS ASSIGN USERID(USR)
                 TERMID(TRM)
                 SCREENHT(SCRH)
                 SCREENWD(SCRW)
END-EXEC
```

### ASKTIME

Refresh the EIB date/time fields and, optionally, return the current
time as a 15-digit absolute timestamp (`ABSTIME`).

#### Format

```
EXEC CICS ASKTIME [ABSTIME(target)]
END-EXEC
```

#### Description

`ASKTIME` re-reads the system clock and writes the current date and
time into `EIBDATE` and `EIBTIME`. Both fields follow the IBM CICS
formats:

* `EIBDATE` — packed-style decimal `0CYYDDD`, where `C` is `(century - 19)`
  and `YYDDD` is the two-digit year and Julian day-of-year. For
  2026-05-12 (Julian day 132), `EIBDATE = 1026132`.
* `EIBTIME` — six-digit `HHMMSS`.

If `ABSTIME(target)` is given, `target` receives a 15-digit decimal
string representing milliseconds since `1900-01-01 00:00:00.000`.
Pass that value to `FORMATTIME` to break it back into formatted
date / time components.

`ASKTIME` is the only way to get a fresh `ABSTIME`; the bricks-specific
`ASSIGN DATE` / `TIME` shortcuts return formatted strings only.

#### Options

**ABSTIME(target)**
   Variable that receives the 15-character absolute time. Optional;
   when omitted, only `EIBDATE` and `EIBTIME` are refreshed.

#### Conditions

| Condition | EIBRESP | Cause |
|---|---:|---|
| NORMAL | 0 | Always (clock reads cannot fail). |

#### Example

```rexx
EXEC CICS ASKTIME ABSTIME(NOW) END-EXEC
EXEC CICS FORMATTIME ABSTIME(NOW)
                     YYYYMMDD(TODAY)
                     TIME(CLOCK) TIMESEP(':')
END-EXEC
SAY 'Stamped at' TODAY CLOCK
```

---

### FORMATTIME

Decode an `ABSTIME` value into formatted date and time fields.

#### Format

```
EXEC CICS FORMATTIME ABSTIME(source)
                     [DATE(t)] [DATEFORM(fmt)] [DATESEP(c)]
                     [YYYYMMDD(t)] [MMDDYYYY(t)] [DDMMYYYY(t)]
                     [MMDDYY(t)]   [DDMMYY(t)]
                     [YYYYDDD(t)]  [YYDDD(t)]
                     [TIME(t)] [TIMESEP(c)]
                     [TIMEZONE(name)]
                     [YEAR(t)] [MONTHOFYEAR(t)] [DAYOFMONTH(t)]
                     [DAYOFWEEK(t)] [DAYCOUNT(t)]
                     [RESP(var)] [RESP2(var)]
END-EXEC
```

`TIMEZONE(name)` is the IBM-canonical per-call zone override —
accepts IANA names (`America/New_York`, `Europe/Paris`) plus the
`UTC` alias. Unknown zone → `INVREQ` with a short clean message.
Without `TIMEZONE`, the handler's configured location (from the
`time_zone` line of `bricks.cnf`) is used.

#### Description

`FORMATTIME` is the IBM-standard companion to `ASKTIME`. Given a
15-digit `ABSTIME` value (typically returned by `ASKTIME ABSTIME(...)`,
but any 15-digit decimal millisecond stamp is accepted), it writes
the requested representations into the named target variables.

Any combination of output options may be requested in a single call;
options that are omitted cost nothing.

#### Options

**ABSTIME(source)** *(required)*
   The 15-digit decimal absolute time to decode.

**DATE(t)** with optional **DATEFORM(fmt)** and **DATESEP(c)**
   Generic date target. `DATEFORM` is one of `YYYYMMDD` (default),
   `MMDDYYYY`, `DDMMYYYY`, `MMDDYY`, `DDMMYY`. `DATESEP(c)` inserts
   a one-character separator between components (e.g. `'-'` →
   `2026-05-12`); omit `DATESEP` for a packed string with no
   separators.

**YYYYMMDD / MMDDYYYY / DDMMYYYY / MMDDYY / DDMMYY**
   Direct date format targets; each respects `DATESEP(c)` if given.

**YYYYDDD(t) / YYDDD(t)**
   Julian-style date with three-digit day-of-year. Honour `DATESEP`.

**TIME(t)** with optional **TIMESEP(c)**
   Six-digit `HHMMSS`, or with `TIMESEP(':')` formatted as `HH:MM:SS`.

**YEAR(t)** — four-digit year (`2026`).
**MONTHOFYEAR(t)** — `1`..`12`.
**DAYOFMONTH(t)** — `1`..`31`.
**DAYOFWEEK(t)** — `0` (Sunday) .. `6` (Saturday), per IBM CICS.
**DAYCOUNT(t)** — days since `1900-01-01` (signed, integer).

#### Conditions

| Condition | EIBRESP | Cause |
|---|---:|---|
| NORMAL | 0 | All requested fields written. |
| INVREQ | 16 | `ABSTIME` is missing, not 15 decimal digits, or out of range. |

#### Example

```cobol
EXEC CICS ASKTIME ABSTIME(WS-NOW) END-EXEC
EXEC CICS FORMATTIME ABSTIME(WS-NOW)
                     DATE(WS-DATE)  DATEFORM('DDMMYYYY')  DATESEP('/')
                     TIME(WS-TIME)  TIMESEP(':')
                     DAYOFWEEK(WS-DOW)
END-EXEC.
*  WS-DATE → "12/05/2026"     WS-TIME → "10:30:45"     WS-DOW → "2"
```

### Security inquiry — `QUERY SECURITY` and `VERIFY PASSWORD`

Read-only programmatic introspection of the running user's
authorisation. The verb lets an application program ask "may this
caller perform action X on resource Y?" before it builds the menu
or before it dispatches a destructive operation. Bricks ships
both `QUERY SECURITY` (this section) and `VERIFY PASSWORD` (the
following section, *Password verification*) in 2.7.x — the first
asks the authorisation question, the second re-authenticates the
caller's credentials.

#### Format

```
EXEC CICS QUERY SECURITY RESOURCE(name)
                         [RESCLASS(class)]
                         [READ(target)]
                         [UPDATE(target)]
                         [CONTROL(target)]
                         [ALTER(target)]
                         [RESP(rc) RESP2(rc2)]
END-EXEC.
```

#### Description

Consults the in-memory user record (loaded from `users.conf`) and
the resource's group list (from the dispatch table). Writes one
`DFHVALUE` integer into each of the four optional target host
variables — the program then compares against the named constants
in the `DFHVALUE` copybook.

The verb is stateless and has no side effects: nothing is logged,
no lock is taken, no journal entry written. Calling it a thousand
times in a tight loop is harmless.

#### Options

| Option | Direction | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `RESOURCE(name)` | input | TRANSID or program name being checked. Required. |
| `RESCLASS(class)` | input | `TCICSTRN` (transactions, default) or `PCICSPSB` (programs). Both class names consult the same transaction-table lookup — bricks has no separate program table, so a TRANSID and the program it dispatches share one ACL row. Anything else → `INVREQ` `QuerySecurityResp2BadResclass` (RESP2=2). |
| `READ(t)` | output | `DFHVALUE-READABLE` (50) when the caller may read, `DFHVALUE-NOTREADABLE` (51) otherwise. |
| `UPDATE(t)` | output | `DFHVALUE-UPDATABLE` (52) / `DFHVALUE-NOTUPDATABLE` (53). |
| `CONTROL(t)` | output | `DFHVALUE-CTRLABLE` (54) / `DFHVALUE-NOTCTRLABLE` (55). |
| `ALTER(t)` | output | `DFHVALUE-ALTERABLE` (56) / `DFHVALUE-NOTALTERABLE` (57). |

A literal-string argument on any output axis (`READ('FOO')`) is
silently skipped — matches the same "literal or empty → no-op" rule
the `RESP(var)` / `RESP2(var)` clauses use everywhere.

The verb is a per-user inquiry, so the caller must be signed on.
A `PUBLIC` resource is reachable at *dispatch* time without sign-on,
but `QUERY SECURITY` answers it like any other resource: an
unauthenticated terminal sees all four axes as the NOT-* code.
After sign-on the verb delegates the READ axis to the same
`txn.IsAllowed` rule the dispatch gate uses — including PUBLIC and
`*` semantics — so a signed-on caller against a `PUBLIC` resource
sees `READ=DFHVALUE-READABLE`.

#### Bricks-flavoured access mapping (explicit deviation)

Real CICS / RACF projects per-class permissions onto the four
axes via a class-specific matrix. Bricks's existing ACL substrate
is binary (you are in the resource's allow-list, or you are not),
so the bricks projection narrows the IBM matrix:

| Axis | Bricks rule |
|---|---|
| `READ` | Caller's userid shares any group with the resource's allow-list, OR the resource has no ACL (open), OR caller is in `ADMIN`. |
| `UPDATE` | Caller is in the `ADMIN` group. |
| `CONTROL` | Caller is in the `ADMIN` group. |
| `ALTER` | Caller is in the `ADMIN` group. |

Document this rule in operator-facing notes alongside any program
that gates a menu on `UPDATE` — "only members of `ADMIN` see the D
key" reads more directly than the abstract DFHVALUE matrix.

#### Conditions

| Condition | EIBRESP | EIBRESP2 | Cause |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| NORMAL | 0 | 0 | Verb completed; up to four host variables written. |
| INVREQ | 16 | `QuerySecurityResp2NoResource` (1) | `RESOURCE(...)` is missing or resolves to the empty string. |
| INVREQ | 16 | `QuerySecurityResp2BadResclass` (2) | `RESCLASS(...)` is neither `TCICSTRN` nor `PCICSPSB`. |
| INVREQ | 16 | `QuerySecurityResp2NoChecker` (3) | The dispatcher did not wire a `SecurityChecker` (operator misconfiguration). |

Unknown resource → `NORMAL` with every requested axis set to the
NOT-* code. No `NOTFND` is emitted: the verb is a yes/no inquiry,
and "I don't know that resource" collapses cleanly to "all axes
denied". Programs that need to distinguish "denied" from "absent"
should pair `QUERY SECURITY` with a separate `INQUIRE` of the
transaction table (not yet implemented; tracked on the deferred
list).

`NOTAUTH` (70) is the IBM-canonical "the caller is not authorised"
response code; `QUERY SECURITY` never emits it (a denied caller
sees `NORMAL` plus the `NOT*` DFHVALUE on each axis). The
`VERIFY PASSWORD` verb in the following section is the verb that
*does* return `NOTAUTH` for a bad-credentials outcome.

The admin group name is hard-coded to `ADMIN` in `main.go`
(`securityAdminGroup`). If a deployment renames it, the
`UPDATE` / `CONTROL` / `ALTER` axes return the NOT-* code for
every user (the `READ` axis is unaffected because it consults
the per-resource `Groups` list, not the admin group). A future
`bricks.cnf` `admin_group=X` knob would lift this hard-coding.

#### DFHVALUE constants

The `runtime/cobolcopy/DFHVALUE.cpy` copybook declares each
constant twice per the `cobol_copybook_dual_names` convention —
once under the bricks-style short name and once under the
`DFHVALUE-` IBM-traditional alias. Either form compiles:

| Bricks mnemonic | IBM alias | Value |
|---|---|---:|
| `READABLE` | `DFHVALUE-READABLE` | 50 |
| `NOTREADABLE` | `DFHVALUE-NOTREADABLE` | 51 |
| `UPDATABLE` | `DFHVALUE-UPDATABLE` | 52 |
| `NOTUPDATABLE` | `DFHVALUE-NOTUPDATABLE` | 53 |
| `CTRLABLE` | `DFHVALUE-CTRLABLE` | 54 |
| `NOTCTRLABLE` | `DFHVALUE-NOTCTRLABLE` | 55 |
| `ALTERABLE` | `DFHVALUE-ALTERABLE` | 56 |
| `NOTALTERABLE` | `DFHVALUE-NOTALTERABLE` | 57 |

> **Storage format — bricks decimal-text deviation.** DFHVALUE
> constants ship as `PIC S9(8) VALUE` (DISPLAY) per the bricks
> decimal-text host-variable convention — see Chapter 8a for the
> same shape on `RBA`. Programs that declare target host vars as

> to the constant; the `DFHVALUE.cpy` header block carries the
> long-form rationale and points back here.

#### COBOL example — gating a Delete menu entry

The shipped `runtime/cobol/gust.cob` sample demonstrates the
typical pattern. In its `DISPATCH` paragraph, before the
`EVALUATE ACTION` switch, an admin gate sits in front of the
`D=Delete` branch:

```cobol
       COPY DFHVALUE.
       ...
       01 WS-CACR-UP PIC S9(8) VALUE 0.
       ...
       IF VALID-ACTION = 'Y' AND ACTION = 'D' THEN
           EXEC CICS QUERY SECURITY RESOURCE('GUST')
                                    UPDATE(WS-CACR-UP) END-EXEC
           IF WS-CACR-UP NOT = DFHVALUE-UPDATABLE THEN
               MOVE 'Delete not permitted for this user.' TO MSG
               MOVE 'N' TO VALID-ACTION
           END-IF
       END-IF.
```

Non-admin callers see the message in `MSG` on the next menu
SEND; admins fall through to the standard `ACT-DELETE` path.

#### REXX example

```rexx
EXEC CICS QUERY SECURITY RESOURCE('GUST'),
                         READ(WS_RD),
                         UPDATE(WS_UP) END-EXEC
IF WS_UP = 52 THEN
    SHOW_DELETE = 'Y'
ELSE
    SHOW_DELETE = 'N'
```

REXX programs may compare against the bare integer (52 above) or
import the same numeric values from a constants stem if the shop
prefers symbolic names.

### Password verification — `VERIFY PASSWORD`

Companion verb to `QUERY SECURITY`. Asks "is this plaintext
password the right one for this userid?" against the same
`users.conf`-backed authenticator `CSSN` uses for sign-on. Used
by batch / SOAP entry points that need to re-authenticate before
a privileged operation, and by terminal screens that want a
"type your password again" gate in front of a destructive
action — even though the session is already signed on.

#### Format

```
EXEC CICS VERIFY PASSWORD USERID(uid)
                          PASSWORD(pwd)
                          [CHANGETIME(t)]
                          [EXPIRYTIME(t)]
                          [DAYSLEFT(d)]
                          [INVALIDCOUNT(n)]
                          [LASTUSETIME(t)]
                          [RESP(rc) RESP2(rc2)]
END-EXEC.
```

#### Description

Re-authenticates the (userid, password) pair against the running
`users.conf` and returns `NORMAL` (0) on success, `NOTAUTH` (70)
on any failure. **The password is compared exactly** — byte for
byte, case included. (The verifier used to try the as-typed,
upper-cased and lower-cased forms against the single stored hash,
so up to three different inputs satisfied this verb for one
account; `VERIFY PASSWORD` inherited that from the shared
authenticator. Exactly one spelling is accepted now. Nothing about
the stored hashes changed — each was always built from the exact
enrolled password.) The userid itself is still matched
case-insensitively. The verb itself is stateless — no journal entry,
no lock — and reads the same in-memory user record `CSSN` consults
at sign-on. Calling it repeatedly is harmless aside from the
bcrypt cost on each call (the FileStore.Authenticate path spends
the same compute on unknown users as on known ones to defeat
username-enumeration via response timing).

#### Options

| Option | Direction | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `USERID(uid)` | input | Userid to verify. Required. Trimmed of surrounding whitespace; empty → `INVREQ` RESP2=1. |
| `PASSWORD(pwd)` | input | Plaintext password. Required. Passed verbatim to the verifier (no trim — leading/trailing whitespace is part of the credential); empty or missing PASSWORD passes through to the verifier and folds onto the standard `NOTAUTH` (70) bad-credential branch. (A fast-reject on empty PASSWORD was withdrawn in review pass 3 — see the Conditions table below for the rationale.) |
| `CHANGETIME(t)` | output | *Parsed but not populated* — see deviation below. |
| `EXPIRYTIME(t)` | output | *Parsed but not populated*. |
| `DAYSLEFT(d)`   | output | *Parsed but not populated*. |
| `INVALIDCOUNT(n)` | output | *Parsed but not populated*. |
| `LASTUSETIME(t)` | output | *Parsed but not populated*. |

#### Bricks deviation — non-distinguishing failure mode (explicit)

> **Loud deviation from IBM RACF.** Real CICS distinguishes
> "unknown userid" from "bad password" via separate RESP2
> sub-codes. **Bricks intentionally does not.** Every authentication
> failure — unknown userid, wrong password, future account lockout,
> rate-limit refusal — collapses onto the single `NOTAUTH` (70)
> result with `RESP2=0`. The motivation is straightforward: this
> verb is safe to expose behind public-facing entry points (a WAPI
> re-auth endpoint, a SOAP credential check), and any RESP2-level
> distinction would let a hostile caller enumerate valid userids
> by inspecting the sub-code. The bricks `FileStore.Authenticate`
> path already pays the bcrypt cost on unknown users for the same
> timing-resistance reason, so the bricks path is uniform end-to-
> end. The contract is enforced in code by the
> `cics.ErrPasswordVerifyBadCredentials` sentinel: every
> `PasswordVerifier` implementation must collapse its failure
> modes onto this single sentinel before returning.

#### Bricks deviation — password-policy outputs not populated

The optional outputs `CHANGETIME` / `EXPIRYTIME` / `DAYSLEFT` /
`INVALIDCOUNT` / `LASTUSETIME` parse cleanly (so source ported
from a real z/OS shop continues to compile) but bricks does not
populate them. Bricks's `users.conf` records bcrypt hash + group
list and nothing else — there is no password-policy metadata to
write back. If the named target is a host variable, it is left
unchanged after the verb returns; if it is a literal, the option
is silently dropped.

A program that relies on `DAYSLEFT` or `EXPIRYTIME` to drive an
"expires in N days" warning must gate that branch on whether
the variable is still at its pre-call value. The shipped
`runtime/rexx/cssr.rexx` sample (below) does not invoke the
optional outputs.

#### Conditions

| Condition | EIBRESP | EIBRESP2 | Cause |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| NORMAL  |  0 | 0 | Credentials matched. |
| NOTAUTH | 70 | 0 | Bad credentials — wrong password OR unknown userid OR empty/missing PASSWORD OR any future failure mode. The sub-code is intentionally 0 to defeat enumeration (see deviation above). |
| INVREQ  | 16 | `VerifyPasswordResp2NoUserid` (1) | `USERID(...)` missing or resolves to the empty string. |
| INVREQ  | 16 | `VerifyPasswordResp2NoVerifier` (3) | The dispatcher did not wire a `PasswordVerifier` (operator misconfiguration). |
| IOERR   | 17 | 0 | The verifier reported a transient error (file-system fault, future store unreachable, ...). The shipped bricks `passwordAdapter` folds every observed `FileStore` error onto `NOTAUTH` today, but custom verifiers may return arbitrary errors that surface as `IOERR` — a deployer who plugs in an LDAP or RACF-passthrough verifier should expect this path to fire. |

> **No `RESP2=2` row.** Sub-code 2 was withdrawn in review pass 3:
> it formerly meant "PASSWORD missing or empty" and was a
> fast-reject before the verifier ran. The wall-clock gap between
> "PASSWORD absent — fast `INVREQ`" and "PASSWORD wrong —
> ran-bcrypt-then-`NOTAUTH`" let an attacker time the verb and learn
> whether the verifier was reached. Empty / missing PASSWORD now
> falls through to the verifier and lands on the standard `NOTAUTH`
> branch. The numeric gap at 2 is preserved deliberately so an
> operator reading a `RESP2=3` log line from a deployed program
> still finds the same "no verifier configured" cause.

> **Refused in CECI.** The CECI debugging shell refuses
> `EXEC CICS VERIFY PASSWORD` outright because the operator's typed
> PASSWORD value would echo on the input pane (and could land in the
> CECI audit log if `ceci_audit` is ever re-enabled). Programs that
> need a "type your password again" gate must run as their own
> TRANSID (see `runtime/rexx/cssr.rexx` for the canonical sample).

#### REXX example — re-authenticate before a privileged action

The shipped `runtime/rexx/cssr.rexx` sample demonstrates the
canonical "type your password again" gate (`CSSR` = "Sign-on
Re-verify"; TRANSID registered in `runtime/transactions.conf`
with `USERS,ADMIN` groups). Usage: type `CSSR` at the bricks
blank prompt; the `CSSRPW` map then prompts for the password in a
HIDDEN (non-echoing) writable field. PF3 cancels without verifying.

```rexx
ADDRESS CICS
EXEC CICS ASSIGN USERID(USR) END-EXEC
MAP.USERID   = USR             /* preload the signed-on user */
MAP.PASSWORD = ''              /* clear any leftover value   */
EXEC CICS SEND    MAP('CSSRPW') FROM(MAP) ERASE END-EXEC
EXEC CICS RECEIVE MAP('CSSRPW') INTO(MAP) END-EXEC
IF EIBAID = '3' THEN DO        /* PF3 = cancel              */
  EXEC CICS SEND TEXT FROM('CSSR cancelled.') ERASE END-EXEC
  EXEC CICS RETURN END-EXEC
END
PWD = STRIP(MAP.PASSWORD)
EXEC CICS VERIFY PASSWORD USERID(USR) PASSWORD(PWD) RESP(RC) END-EXEC
IF RC = 0 THEN
  MSG = 'Password OK. Privileged step authorised.'
ELSE IF RC = 70 THEN
  MSG = 'Bad credentials. Privileged step refused.'
ELSE
  MSG = 'VERIFY PASSWORD failed RESP=' || RC || ' RESP2=' || EIBRESP2
EXEC CICS SEND TEXT FROM(MSG) ERASE END-EXEC
EXEC CICS RETURN END-EXEC
```

The `RESP(RC)` clause writes the result into a host variable
inline so the `IF RC = 70` branch reads cleanly instead of
fishing through `EIBRESP` after the fact.

> **Why the map, not a command-tail.** A prior draft of CSSR read
> the password from the initial-input buffer (`CSSR <password>`).
> That pattern echoes the password on the 3270 input pane, drops

> echo if an operator ever reissues the command from there. The
> shipped sample uses a `CSSRPW` map whose `PASSWORD` writable

#### COBOL idiom — gating LINK with a typed-again password

The same pattern in COBOL. The `WS-PWD` field is the operator's
re-typed password (collected on a `RECEIVE MAP` from a sensitive-
action confirmation screen, not shown). On `NOTAUTH` the program
falls through to a refuse-message path; on `NORMAL` it can `LINK`
to the privileged sub-program.

```cobol
       77  WS-VP-RC PIC S9(8) VALUE 0.
       77  WS-USR   PIC X(8).
       77  WS-PWD   PIC X(32).
       ...
       EXEC CICS ASSIGN USERID(WS-USR) END-EXEC
       EXEC CICS VERIFY PASSWORD USERID(WS-USR)
                                 PASSWORD(WS-PWD)
                                 RESP(WS-VP-RC) END-EXEC
       EVALUATE WS-VP-RC
           WHEN 0
               EXEC CICS LINK PROGRAM('ADMNDEL') END-EXEC
           WHEN 70
               MOVE 'Password does not match. Try again.' TO MSG
           WHEN OTHER
               MOVE 'VERIFY PASSWORD failed (config?).' TO MSG
       END-EVALUATE.
```

The `EXEC CICS ASSIGN USERID(WS-USR)` step is the canonical way to
read the signed-on userid into a host variable — bricks does **not**
populate an `EIBUSER` field, so a port from a z/OS shop that used
`USERID(EIBUSER)` directly must be rewritten to go through `ASSIGN`
first. The shipped `runtime/rexx/cssr.rexx` sample uses the REXX
flavour of the same pattern.

A COBOL caller that intends to `EVALUATE WS-VP-RC WHEN 70` must
declare `WS-VP-RC` as plain `PIC S9(8)` (DISPLAY) to match the
bricks decimal-text host-variable convention — same rule as the
DFHVALUE constants documented under `QUERY SECURITY` above.

### System inquiry — `INQUIRE SYSTEM`

> **Recently added in 2.7.x.** `INQUIRE SYSTEM` is the entry point
> for SIT-level inquiries — values the operator set in `bricks.cnf`
> that a program needs at run time. Bricks v1 honours **only** the
> `GMMTEXT` option (the IBM CICS canonical "Good Morning" sign-on
> text); the dispatch infrastructure is in place so future SIT
> options (`RELEASE`, `CICSSTATUS`, `MAXTASKS`, `JOBNAME`, `APPLID`,
> `SYSID`) extend the same verb without touching the Handler /
> Dispatcher field set.

#### Format

```
EXEC CICS INQUIRE SYSTEM
    [GMMTEXT(var)]
    [RESP(rc)] [RESP2(rc2)]
END-EXEC
```

#### Description

Reads SIT-level configuration into the program. v1 honours only the
`GMMTEXT(var)` option, which writes the configured `gmtext=` value
from `bricks.cnf` (default `"Welcome to bricks"`) into the named
host variable. A bare `INQUIRE SYSTEM` (no options, or only
RESP/RESP2) is a no-op success matching real CICS.

#### Options

| Option | Bricks v1 behaviour |
|---|---|
| `GMMTEXT(var)` | Writes the configured GMTEXT into `var`. Full 256-byte value is delivered verbatim — no truncation at verb time. (The bricks LogonPrompt renderer truncates to `cols-1` at paint time, but the verb's host-variable surface preserves the full storage.) |
| Other (RELEASE, CICSSTATUS, MAXTASKS, JOBNAME, APPLID, SYSID, etc.) | Not yet supported in v1 — surfaces `INVREQ` with `EIBRESP2 = 1`. |

#### Conditions

| Condition | EIBRESP | EIBRESP2 | Cause |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| NORMAL | 0 | 0 | Verb succeeded. Bare `INQUIRE SYSTEM` (no options) also returns NORMAL even when the dispatcher hasn't wired a `SystemInfoProvider`. |
| INVREQ | 16 | 1 | The operator named an option v1 doesn't honour yet. The diagnostic names the option. |
| INVREQ | 16 | 2 | `h.SystemInfo == nil` AND a substantive option was named — the dispatcher did not wire a provider. Mirrors the QUERY SECURITY / VERIFY PASSWORD `RESP2=3` loud-fail convention. |

**Reserved RESP2 sub-codes 3..9** are kept free for future INQUIRE
form sub-errors (INQUIRE FILE, INQUIRE TASK, etc.). v1 programs
that pin numeric RESP2 codes will continue to see only `1` or `2`
for INQUIRE SYSTEM; future bricks releases will not silently
re-bind these reservations.

#### Bricks deviations (loud)

Per the `bricks_cics_ibm_canonical` memory every deviation from
IBM canonical INQUIRE SYSTEM is called out individually below.

> **Bricks deviation — `GMMTEXT` is the only honoured option in v1.**
>
> Of the 30+ IBM `INQUIRE SYSTEM` options (`RELEASE`, `CICSSTATUS`,
> `MAXTASKS`, `JOBNAME`, `APPLID`, `SYSID`, ...) bricks v1 honours
> only `GMMTEXT`. Any other named option surfaces `INVREQ`
> `RESP2=1` with the option name in the diagnostic, so a port from
> a z/OS shop fails loudly rather than silently returning zero /
> empty. Adding any deferred option is a ~5-line extension to the
> `cics.SystemInfoProvider` interface (one new method) plus a
> single case in `cics/inquire.go`'s `inquireSystem` handler — no
> Handler / Dispatcher / Frame changes.

> **Bricks deviation — EBCDIC-037 fail-fast at startup.**
>
> The `gmtext=` value is validated against the EBCDIC-037
> printable range (`0x20..0x7E`) minus the
> `3270_ebcdic_037_printables` deny-set (`[ ] { } ~ \ ` `` ` ``
> `| ^`) at config load. A `gmtext=` containing any non-printable
> byte (e.g. an embedded bell `\x07`, a control character, or a
> non-ASCII glyph) or any deny-set glyph is a startup error. Real
> CICS would silently substitute on the wire; bricks refuses to
> start so the operator notices.

> **Bricks deviation — empty `gmtext=` restores the default.**
>
> A bare `gmtext=` line (or one with only whitespace inside the
> quotes) DOES NOT blank the banner — it restores the
> `"Welcome to bricks"` default. Mirrors the `ntp_server=on`
> aliasing precedent and matches the bricks last-wins-per-key
> configuration policy. An operator who genuinely wants no banner
> cannot achieve that via `gmtext=`; the only way to suppress the
> sign-on banner entirely is to leave both `gmtext=` and the
> legacy welcome line out of the LogonPrompt path (currently not
> possible without a code change).

> **Bricks deviation — GMTEXT replaces the legacy welcomeLine on every welcome screen.**
>
> GMTEXT is painted at row 0 of the connect-time `ShowLogoSplash`
> AND at row 1 of the `LogonPrompt` (when
> `enforce_secure_login=yes`) AND on the CSSF LOGOFF confirmation
> splash. The legacy `Welcome to BRICKS HH:MM:SS` banner with
> timestamp only paints when `gmtext=` is empty or absent.
> `BlankPrompt` (the steady-state TRANSID cursor) is NOT a banner
> site — adding GMTEXT there would repaint on every return from
> a transaction, which surprises operators.
>
> Real CICS paints both the GMTEXT and a "good morning" line on
> the sign-on prompt. Bricks stacks neither — the operator sees
> one centred banner instead of two, which the architect's C7
> review flagged as the correct layout. When `gmtext=` is empty /
> whitespace (which the config load layer should have already
> restored to default, but the renderer composes safely either
> way) the legacy welcomeLine paints as fallback.

#### Sample REXX

The shipped `runtime/rexx/gmtq.rexx` (TRANSID `GMTQ`) demonstrates
the recommended idiom — RESP(RC) for clean error branching, no
comma-continuations inside the EXEC body (per the
`bricks_rexx_exec_one_line` memory):

```rexx
/* GMTQ -- read GMTEXT and echo it to the terminal. */
ADDRESS CICS

MSG = ''
EXEC CICS INQUIRE SYSTEM GMMTEXT(MSG) RESP(RC) END-EXEC

IF RC \= 0 THEN
  MSG = 'INQUIRE SYSTEM GMMTEXT failed; EIBRESP=' || RC || ' EIBRESP2=' || EIBRESP2

EXEC CICS SEND TEXT FROM(MSG) ERASE END-EXEC
EXEC CICS RETURN END-EXEC
```

A program that omits `RESP(RC)` still gets the Go-level error in
`EIBRESP` via the existing captureRespVars pipeline (a `RESP`
clause that names a host variable is the recommended shape for
clean per-call error branching; the `EIBRESP` post-check shape
also works).

#### SIT-knob — `gmtext=` in `bricks.cnf`

```
# bricks.cnf
gmtext="Sample bank -- production"   # max 256 bytes, EBCDIC-037 printable only
```

Defaults to `"Welcome to bricks"` when the line is absent or empty.
See [Configuration — `bricks.cnf`](README.md#configuration--brickscnf)
in the README for the full knob reference.

### ADDRESS — `EXEC CICS ADDRESS`

> **Storage addressing.** `ADDRESS` hands a program a pointer to a
> CICS-owned storage area — the COMMAREA, the EIB, the region CWA,
> or the per-task TWA. It is the front half of the bricks COBOL
> pointer model: the handle `ADDRESS` writes into a `USAGE POINTER`
> item is later mapped onto a based LINKAGE 01 with
> [`SET ADDRESS OF`](#cobol-pointer-model-usage-pointer--set-address-of). See
> [Chapter 22 — pointers](#cobol-pointer-model-usage-pointer--set-address-of)
> for the COBOL surface.

#### Format

```
EXEC CICS ADDRESS
    [COMMAREA(ptr)] [EIB(ptr)] [CWA(ptr)] [TWA(ptr)]
    [TCTUA(ptr)] [ACEE(ptr)]
    [RESP(rc)] [RESP2(rc2)]
END-EXEC
```

#### Description

Each named option's `ptr` operand (a `USAGE POINTER` item in COBOL)
is set to an opaque **handle** addressing the requested area.
A COBOL program then maps a based LINKAGE 01 onto those bytes with
`SET ADDRESS OF L TO ptr`. The handles are not displayable machine
addresses, but `SET ptr UP/DOWN BY n` arithmetic *is* supported — it
adjusts the offset **within the pointer's current target buffer** (see
the [COBOL pointer model](#cobol-pointer-model-usage-pointer--set-address-of)).

In **REXX** `ADDRESS` is accept-and-no-op: every operand is set to
`0` (NULL) and `NORMAL` is returned. REXX has no pointers — the data
a REXX program needs (COMMAREA, EIB fields) is already injected as
variables — so the verb exists only for source compatibility.

#### Options

| Option | Handle addresses | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `COMMAREA(ptr)` | `DFHCOMMAREA` | Always a non-NULL handle (the based `DFHCOMMAREA` default buffer always exists). `EIBCALEN` tells you whether a caller actually flowed bytes in. |
| `EIB(ptr)` | `DFHEIB` | Always non-NULL. Maps the real `01 DFHEIB` block (children `EIBRESP`, `EIBAID`, `EIBCALEN`, …). |
| `CWA(ptr)` | region Common Work Area | NULL (handle `0`) **when `wrkarea=0`** in `bricks.cnf`. One slice shared by every task; writes are visible region-wide (unsynchronised). Length via `ASSIGN CWALENG`. |
| `TWA(ptr)` | per-task Transaction Work Area | NULL when the transaction's `TWASIZE` (`transactions.conf` 6th field) is `0`. Fresh per task. Length via `ASSIGN TWALENG`. |
| `TCTUA(ptr)` | terminal user area | **Always NULL** — not modelled in bricks. |
| `ACEE(ptr)` | security ACEE | **Always NULL** — not modelled in bricks. |

`CSA` and `TCTTE` are **not** accepted (both obsolete as addressable
areas in modern CICS); naming them — or any other option — returns
`INVREQ`.

#### Conditions

| Condition | EIBRESP | Cause |
|---|---:|---|
| NORMAL | 0 | The named areas were addressed. NULL is still NORMAL — a NULL handle for an unconfigured CWA / TWA (or for TCTUA / ACEE) is the documented outcome, not an error. |
| INVREQ | 16 | An option other than the accepted set was named (e.g. `CSA`, `TCTTE`). The diagnostic names the option. |

#### Bricks deviations (loud)

> **Bricks deviation — TCTUA and ACEE are always NULL.**
> Neither the per-terminal user area nor the security ACEE is
> modelled. `ADDRESS TCTUA(p)` / `ADDRESS ACEE(p)` return `NORMAL`
> with `p` set to `0`; a program that dereferences either gets a
> clean NULL-pointer abend, not silent garbage.

> **Bricks deviation — `ADDRESS CWA` is NULL unless `wrkarea>0`.**
> A region with no configured CWA (the default `wrkarea=0`) yields
> a NULL CWA handle — exactly as real CICS does on a region with no
> CWA. Set `wrkarea=` in `bricks.cnf` to allocate one.

> **The CWA is unsynchronized — serialize updates with `ENQ`/`DEQ`.**
> The region CWA is a single byte slice shared by reference into every
> concurrent task; bricks does **not** auto-serialize access (neither
> does real CICS). Concurrent unsynchronized writes from different tasks
> are undefined — guard CWA updates with `EXEC CICS ENQ` / `DEQ`, as on
> real CICS.

#### Example (COBOL)

```cobol
01 WS-CPTR  USAGE POINTER.
...
EXEC CICS ADDRESS COMMAREA(WS-CPTR) END-EXEC.
IF EIBCALEN = 0 THEN
    DISPLAY 'no commarea flowed in'
END-IF.
SET ADDRESS OF DFHCOMMAREA TO WS-CPTR.
```

The shipped `runtime/cobol/gmpt.cob` (TRANSID `GMPT`) exercises
`ADDRESS COMMAREA` and `ADDRESS EIB` alongside GETMAIN.

---

### GETMAIN / FREEMAIN — `EXEC CICS GETMAIN`, `EXEC CICS FREEMAIN`

> **Dynamic task storage.** `GETMAIN` allocates a buffer from the
> task heap and writes a pointer to it into a `USAGE POINTER` item;
> `FREEMAIN` releases it. Together with
> [`SET ADDRESS OF`](#cobol-pointer-model-usage-pointer--set-address-of) they let a
> COBOL program build and address records whose size or count isn't
> known at compile time.

#### Format

```
EXEC CICS GETMAIN SET(ptr)
    {FLENGTH(n) | LENGTH(n)}
    [INITIMG(byte)] [SHARED] [NOSUSPEND]
    [USERDATAKEY | CICSDATAKEY]
    [RESP(rc)] [RESP2(rc2)]
END-EXEC

EXEC CICS FREEMAIN {DATA(area) | DATAPOINTER(ptr)}
    [RESP(rc)] [RESP2(rc2)]
END-EXEC
```

#### Description

`GETMAIN` allocates `n` bytes (`FLENGTH` preferred, `LENGTH`
accepted as a synonym), fills every byte with `INITIMG` (first byte
of the operand; default `0x00`), and writes the buffer's handle into
the `SET` pointer. `n ≤ 0` is `LENGERR`. A program then maps a based
LINKAGE 01 onto the buffer with `SET ADDRESS OF L TO ptr` and
reads / writes through the based item.

`FREEMAIN` resolves its operand to a GETMAIN handle and releases the
buffer. `DATAPOINTER(ptr)` names a pointer variable holding the
handle directly; `DATA(area)` names the based data area whose
current address is the handle. Freeing an address that was **not**
obtained by GETMAIN (e.g. `ADDRESS OF` a declared item, or a stale /
zero handle) is `INVREQ`.

In **REXX** both verbs are accept-and-no-op: `GETMAIN` still
validates the length (`LENGERR` on `≤ 0`) and writes a non-zero
dummy handle so control flow is preserved, but no real bytes back
it; `FREEMAIN` returns `NORMAL` with nothing to free.

#### Options

| Option | Verb | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `SET(ptr)` | GETMAIN | **Required.** Receives the buffer handle. |
| `FLENGTH(n)` / `LENGTH(n)` | GETMAIN | Allocation size in bytes; `FLENGTH` wins if both appear. |
| `INITIMG(byte)` | GETMAIN | Fill byte (first byte of the operand). Default `0x00`. |
| `SHARED` | GETMAIN | Accepted for source compatibility — **see the loud deviation below; NOT region-scoped in bricks.** |
| `NOSUSPEND` | GETMAIN | Accepted no-op (bricks never suspends a GETMAIN). |
| `USERDATAKEY` / `CICSDATAKEY` | GETMAIN | Accepted no-ops (bricks has no storage-key model). |
| `DATA(area)` / `DATAPOINTER(ptr)` | FREEMAIN | Identifies the buffer to release. |

#### Conditions

| Condition | EIBRESP | Cause |
|---|---:|---|
| NORMAL | 0 | GETMAIN allocated and wrote the handle; FREEMAIN released the buffer. |
| LENGERR | 22 | GETMAIN length ≤ 0. |
| NOSTG | 42 | GETMAIN length exceeds the 16 MiB region storage limit — no buffer is allocated. |
| INVREQ | 16 | GETMAIN with no `SET`; or FREEMAIN of an address not obtained by GETMAIN (including a zero / NULL handle). |

#### Bricks deviations (loud)

> **Bricks deviation — `SHARED` GETMAIN is NOT region-scoped.**
> Real CICS `SHARED` storage survives the allocating task and is
> reachable region-wide. Bricks frees **every** task GETMAIN buffer
> (SHARED or not) when the task's storage is dropped at task end —
> there is no region-scoped storage pool yet. The `SHARED` flag is
> accepted so ports compile, but a program relying on cross-task
> SHARED storage will not see it persist. **Use a TS queue or the
> CWA (`ADDRESS CWA`, `wrkarea=`) for genuinely cross-task data.**

> **Bricks note — pointer arithmetic is per-buffer.**
> GETMAIN handles are opaque interned `(buffer, offset)` pairs.
> `SET ptr UP BY n` / `DOWN BY n` adjusts the offset **within the same
> buffer** the pointer already addresses; it does not walk across
> separate allocations. A past-end offset is allowed until
> dereferenced (then a clean abend); below `0` or on a NULL pointer the
> `SET` itself diagnoses cleanly. See the
> [COBOL pointer model](#cobol-pointer-model-usage-pointer--set-address-of).

#### Example (COBOL)

```cobol
01 WS-PTR  USAGE POINTER.
LINKAGE SECTION.
01 GM-AREA BASED.
   05 GM-TEXT PIC X(16).
PROCEDURE DIVISION.
    EXEC CICS GETMAIN SET(WS-PTR) FLENGTH(16) INITIMG(' ') END-EXEC.
    SET ADDRESS OF GM-AREA TO WS-PTR.
    MOVE 'POINTER-OK' TO GM-TEXT.        *> writes into the GETMAIN buffer
    EXEC CICS FREEMAIN DATAPOINTER(WS-PTR) END-EXEC.
```

The shipped `runtime/cobol/gmpt.cob` (TRANSID `GMPT`) runs exactly
this round-trip and paints the read-back via `SEND TEXT`.

---

### INQUIRE / SET resources — `FILE`, `TASK`, `TRANSACTION`, `TERMINAL`, `PROGRAM`

> **Resource inquiry.** Beyond `INQUIRE SYSTEM` (SIT values), bricks
> honours `INQUIRE` / `SET` for five resource classes, in both the
> direct and browse access shapes. Status attributes return the IBM
> happy-path defaults; sizes and counts bricks actually tracks are
> real.

#### Format

```
Direct:  EXEC CICS INQUIRE <class>(name) <attr(var)>... [RESP(rc)] END-EXEC

Browse:  EXEC CICS STARTBROWSE <class> [RESP(rc)] END-EXEC
         EXEC CICS INQUIRE <class>(area) NEXT <attr(var)>... RESP(rc) END-EXEC   (repeat)
         EXEC CICS ENDBROWSE <class> END-EXEC

Set:     EXEC CICS SET <class>(name) <attr(value)>... [RESP(rc)] END-EXEC
```

`<class>` is one of `FILE`, `TASK`, `TRANSACTION`, `TERMINAL`,
`PROGRAM`.

#### Description

**Direct** reads one named resource's attributes into host
variables. **Browse** freezes the resource-name list at
`STARTBROWSE` and walks it one resource per `INQUIRE … NEXT`: the
class option (`INQUIRE FILE(area) NEXT`) receives the current
resource's name and the attribute options receive its values; the
cursor advances each call and returns `END` at exhaustion. One
browse per class per task. **SET** validates the named resource
exists and returns `NORMAL` — see the loud deviation: it does **not**
persist a state change.

#### Attribute accept-lists per class

| Class | `INQUIRE` attributes | Real vs. default |
|---|---|---|
| `FILE(name)` | `ENABLESTATUS` `OPENSTATUS` `RECORDSIZE` `KEYLENGTH` `KEYPOSITION` `RECORDFORMAT` `ACCESSMETHOD` `BASEDSNAME` | `RECORDSIZE`/`KEYLENGTH`/`BASEDSNAME` are **real** (store catalog). `ENABLESTATUS=ENABLED`, `OPENSTATUS=OPEN`, `KEYPOSITION=0`, `RECORDFORMAT=VARIABLE`, `ACCESSMETHOD=VSAM` are defaults. |
| `TASK(id)` | `TRANSACTION` `FACILITY` `USERID` `RUNSTATUS` `PRIORITY` | `TRANSACTION`/`FACILITY`/`USERID` are **real**. `RUNSTATUS=RUNNING`, `PRIORITY=1` are defaults. `id` is the numeric `EIBTASKN` form. |
| `TRANSACTION(name)` | `STATUS` `PROGRAM` `PRIORITY` `TWASIZE` `PROFILE` | `PROGRAM`/`TWASIZE` are **real**. `STATUS=ENABLED`, `PRIORITY=1`, `PROFILE=DFHCICST` are defaults. |
| `TERMINAL(id)` | `ACQSTATUS` `SERVSTATUS` `USERID` `NETNAME` | `USERID`/`NETNAME` are **real**. `ACQSTATUS=ACQUIRED`, `SERVSTATUS=INSERVICE` are defaults. |
| `PROGRAM(name)` | `STATUS` `LANGUAGE` `PROGTYPE` `RESCOUNT` `USECOUNT` `LENGTH` | `LANGUAGE` (`COBOL`/`REXX`) and `USECOUNT` are **real**. `STATUS=ENABLED`, `PROGTYPE=PROGRAM`, `RESCOUNT=0`, `LENGTH=0` are defaults. |

`SET <class>(name)` accepts the same class option and the documented
mutation attributes (e.g. `SET FILE('x') OPENSTATUS(CLOSED)`,
`SET TRANSACTION('x') STATUS(DISABLED)`).

#### Conditions

| Condition | EIBRESP | Where |
|---|---:|---|
| NORMAL | 0 | Direct INQUIRE / SET succeeded; `INQUIRE … NEXT` returned a resource; STARTBROWSE / ENDBROWSE succeeded. |
| END | 83 | `INQUIRE <class> NEXT` after the last resource — the browse is exhausted. |
| NOTFND | 13 | Direct INQUIRE / SET named a resource that doesn't exist. |
| INVREQ | 16 | Unknown resource class; an unknown attribute keyword; a direct INQUIRE with no resource name and no `NEXT`; `ENDBROWSE` with no open browse. |
| ILLOGIC | 21 | `INQUIRE <class> NEXT` with no `STARTBROWSE` active for that class. |

#### Bricks deviations (loud)

> **Bricks deviation — status attributes are IBM defaults, not live
> state.** Bricks has no persistent resource-state model. Every
> status field (`OPENSTATUS`, `ENABLESTATUS`, `RUNSTATUS`,
> `ACQSTATUS`, `SERVSTATUS`, transaction / program `STATUS`) returns
> the IBM happy-path default. A program must not rely on `INQUIRE`
> to discover that a file is CLOSED or a transaction DISABLED — that
> state is never modelled. The attributes bricks genuinely tracks
> (`RECORDSIZE`, `KEYLENGTH`, `LANGUAGE`, `USECOUNT`, `TWASIZE`,
> `PROGRAM`, `USERID`, `TRANSACTION`, …) are real.

> **Bricks deviation — `SET` is acknowledge-only.** `SET FILE(…)
> OPENSTATUS(CLOSED)`, `SET TRANSACTION(…) STATUS(DISABLED)`, etc.
> validate that the named resource exists (`NOTFND` if not) and
> return `NORMAL`, but **do not persist** the change — the very next
> `INQUIRE` would otherwise contradict the SET. This is deliberate:
> bricks fails honestly rather than faking a state transition it
> can't keep.

#### Example (REXX) — direct + browse

```rexx
ADDRESS CICS

/* Direct: this task's own attributes. */
EXEC CICS ASSIGN EIBTASKN(MYTASK) END-EXEC
EXEC CICS INQUIRE TASK(MYTASK) RUNSTATUS(RS) TRANSACTION(TR) RESP(RC) END-EXEC

/* Browse: walk every FILE. RC goes non-zero (END) at exhaustion. */
EXEC CICS STARTBROWSE FILE RESP(RC) END-EXEC
DO WHILE RC = 0
  FN = ''
  EXEC CICS INQUIRE FILE(FN) NEXT OPENSTATUS(OS) RECORDSIZE(RZ) RESP(RC) END-EXEC
  IF RC = 0 THEN SAY FN OS RZ
END
EXEC CICS ENDBROWSE FILE END-EXEC
```

The shipped `runtime/rexx/inqr.rexx` (TRANSID `INQR`) runs this
direct-plus-browse pattern and paints the result with `SEND TEXT`.

# Part 5. EXEC CICS file and queue commands

> **Part&nbsp;5 begins here.** This part covers the persistent and
> ephemeral data services — VSAM-style KSDS files and the temporary-
> storage / transient-data queue families. Both surfaces are
> per-task and bound by the same SYNCPOINT mechanism described in
> [Chapter 10](#chapter-10-recovery-and-condition-handling).

## Chapter 7. KSDS file commands

> **VSAM in Bricks.** Bricks's KSDS file surface is the application-
> programmer's view of the persistent record store. Each FILE name
> in `EXEC CICS READ FILE(name)` corresponds to a B+tree bucket in
> the embedded `data/files.boltdb` database. A separate `DEFINE
> CLUSTER` step is **optional**: the first `EXEC CICS WRITE` creates
> the bucket if it isn't already there, and subsequent `READ` /
> `REWRITE` / `DELETE` / `STARTBR` / `READNEXT` / `READPREV` /
> `RESETBR` / `ENDBR` see it. Records are opaque byte payloads; the
> application chooses the layout (typically a pipe-delimited group
> of fields, the convention every sample uses).
>
> Operators who want the classic mainframe lifecycle — declare a
> cluster with `DEFINE CLUSTER`, bulk-load it from a sequential file
> with `REPRO`, drop it with `DELETE`, enumerate the catalogue with
> `LISTCAT`, dump records with `PRINT` — should use the **IDCA**
> transaction described under *VSAM file management* below. Files
> created through IDCAMS and files auto-created by `EXEC CICS WRITE`
> are byte-identical: same bucket, same `_catalog` row, same
> `CEMT INQUIRE FILE` view.

These commands operate on a **single record**, identified by a key,
in a CICS FILE. Each FILE is a bbolt bucket inside
`data/files.boltdb`; record bodies are opaque bytes (the application
chooses the layout). See *How file storage works* in the README for
the on-disk model.

### READ

Read a record from a KSDS by key.

#### Format

```
EXEC CICS READ FILE(name)
              {INTO(target) | SET(target)}
              RIDFLD(key)
              [UPDATE]
              [LENGTH(len)]
END-EXEC
```

#### Description

B+tree exact-key lookup, O(log n). The record bytes (whatever the
application stored) come back into the target. `UPDATE` records a
per-session lock on the key, gating a subsequent `REWRITE` on the
same FILE.

When `LENGTH(var)` is a bare variable, the actual record length is
written back.

#### Options

**FILE(name)** *— required*
   The CICS FILE name.

**INTO(target)** / **SET(target)** *— one required*
   Destination for the record body. `INTO` and `SET` are accepted
   interchangeably here.

**RIDFLD(key)** *— required*
   The key to look up.

**UPDATE**
   Record a per-session lock so a subsequent `REWRITE` can update
   this record.

**LENGTH(len)**
   Receives the record's actual length when the option is a bare
   variable.

#### Bricks deviation from IBM canonical

`LENGTH(var)` on `READ FILE` is OUTPUT-only, not input-as-max-
buffer. Real CICS VSAM variable-length reads `LENGTH(var)` as a cap
on the bytes returned and writes back the actual size; bricks
ignores the input value and only writes back. The write-back-then-
read-as-input shape would otherwise corrupt subsequent reads in a
loop (`LENGTH(LEN)` on call 1 stores 4; call 2 silently caps a
13-byte record to 4). The bricks KSDS store is fixed-size-per-
record so there is no operator-meaningful truncation here.

#### Conditions

| Condition | EIBRESP | Cause |
|---|---:|---|
| NORMAL | 0 | Record returned. |
| NOTFND | 13 | Key not present. |
| INVREQ | 16 | Missing required option, or invalid file name. |
| IOERR | 17 | Underlying store error. |

#### Example

```rexx
EXEC CICS READ FILE('CUSTOMERS')
              INTO(REC) RIDFLD(CKEY)
END-EXEC
IF EIBRESP = 13 THEN MSG = 'Customer not found'
```

### WRITE

Insert a new record into a KSDS.

#### Format

```
EXEC CICS WRITE FILE(name)
               FROM(data) [LENGTH(n)]
               RIDFLD(key)
               [MASSINSERT]
               [RESP(var)] [RESP2(var)]
END-EXEC
```

`LENGTH(n)` is the IBM in/out parameter — caller's value caps the
bytes written, returned value is the actual bytes stored.
`MASSINSERT` is accepted for source compatibility; bricks's KSDS
engine is uniformly fast so the flag is a silent hint.

#### Description

B+tree insert. The bucket for the FILE is created implicitly on
first WRITE — there is no `EXEC CICS DEFINE FILE` step. `DUPREC` if
a record with the same key already exists.

The write commits in a single bbolt `Update` transaction with `fsync`
on success.

#### Options

**FILE(name)** *— required*
   Target FILE. Created if absent.

**FROM(data)** *— required*
   The record bytes to store.

**RIDFLD(key)** *— required*
   The key under which to store the record.

#### Conditions

| Condition | EIBRESP | Cause |
|---|---:|---|
| NORMAL | 0 | Record written. |
| DUPREC | 14 | A record with this key already exists. |
| INVREQ | 16 | Missing required option, or invalid name. |
| IOERR | 17 | Underlying store error. |

#### Example

```rexx
REC = NM || '|' || AD || '|' || CY || '|' || PH
EXEC CICS WRITE FILE('CUSTOMERS') FROM(REC) RIDFLD(CKEY) END-EXEC
```

---

### REWRITE

Replace the record locked by the most recent `READ … UPDATE`.

#### Format

```
EXEC CICS REWRITE FILE(name)
                 FROM(data)
END-EXEC
```

#### Description

Overwrites the value at the key locked by the most recent `READ
FILE … UPDATE` on the same FILE. Releases the per-FCB update lock at
end of transaction.

> **Bricks deviation from IBM canonical:** `READ UPDATE` + `REWRITE`
> do **not** survive the `CECI` `PF5` boundary. Real conversational
> CICS programs hold the UPDATE lock across the operator's pause;
> `CECI` in bricks treats each `PF5` press as an implicit
> `SYNCPOINT`, which releases non-`HOLD` locks. Recommended
> patterns: type both verbs on one `PF5` input (assembled as a
> single command), or wrap the pair with
> `ENQ resource HOLD … DEQ resource` so the lock persists across
> the press. Outside `CECI` (REXX or COBOL programs running as a
> normal task) the lock survives until the next `SYNCPOINT` or
> task end, matching real CICS.

#### Options

**FILE(name)** *— required*
**FROM(data)** *— required*

#### Conditions

| Condition | EIBRESP | Cause |
|---|---:|---|
| NORMAL | 0 | Record updated. |
| INVREQ | 16 | No prior `READ … UPDATE`, or the lock has been released. |
| IOERR | 17 | Underlying store error. |

#### Example

```rexx
EXEC CICS READ FILE('CUSTOMERS') INTO(REC) RIDFLD(CKEY) UPDATE END-EXEC
PARSE VAR REC NM '|' AD '|' CY '|' PH
PH = NEWPHONE                                       /* mutate */
REC = NM || '|' || AD || '|' || CY || '|' || PH
EXEC CICS REWRITE FILE('CUSTOMERS') FROM(REC) END-EXEC
```

---

### DELETE

Remove a record from a KSDS.

#### Format

```
EXEC CICS DELETE FILE(name)
                [RIDFLD(key) [KEYLENGTH(n) GENERIC [NUMREC(var)]]]
                [RESP(var)] [RESP2(var)]
END-EXEC
```

#### Description

If `RIDFLD` is supplied, deletes that key. Otherwise deletes the key
locked by the most recent `READ … UPDATE` on the same FILE.

**IBM-canonical GENERIC delete-by-prefix:** with `KEYLENGTH(n)
GENERIC`, every record whose key starts with the first `n` bytes
of `RIDFLD` is deleted. The count goes back through `NUMREC(var)`
when supplied; `RC = NOTFND` when no record matches.

#### Options

**FILE(name)** *— required*

**RIDFLD(key)**
   Optional. When omitted, the most recent READ-UPDATE key is used.

#### Conditions

| Condition | EIBRESP | Cause |
|---|---:|---|
| NORMAL | 0 | Record deleted. |
| NOTFND | 13 | Key not present. |
| INVREQ | 16 | No `RIDFLD` and no prior READ-UPDATE; or invalid name. |
| IOERR | 17 | Underlying store error. |

#### Example

```rexx
EXEC CICS DELETE FILE('CUSTOMERS') RIDFLD(CKEY) END-EXEC
```

### VSAM file management — the IDCA (IDCAMS) transaction

`IDCA` is the BRICKS equivalent of mainframe **IDCAMS / AMSERV** —
an Access Method Services screen for declaring, loading, dropping,
listing, and printing VSAM-style KSDS clusters without writing an
application program. It is a built-in transaction (no entry in
`runtime/transactions.conf` is required) and is **admin-only**: only
signed-on users in the `admin` group see the screen.

#### Invocation

At the `>` prompt on any 3270 terminal, type:

```
IDCA
```

ENTER drops you into a SYSIN / SYSPRINT screen. Type one or more
control statements in the SYSIN area, press ENTER to run them, and
the SYSPRINT area shows classic `IDC0001I FUNCTION COMPLETED…`-style
messages plus the highest condition code. `PF5` clears the input;
`PF7` / `PF8` scroll the listing; `PF3` exits.

#### Supported commands

| Command | Syntax |
|---|---|
| **DEFINE CLUSTER** | `DEFINE CLUSTER (NAME(name) [RECORDSIZE(avg max)] [KEYS(len off)] [INDEXED] [REPLACE])` |
| **REPRO** (load) | `REPRO INFILE(seq-file) OUTFILE(cluster) [KEYS(len off)] [SKIP(n)] [COUNT(n)]` |
| **REPRO** (unload) | `REPRO INFILE(cluster) OUTFILE(seq-file) [COUNT(n)]` |
| **DELETE** | `DELETE name [CLUSTER]` |
| **LISTCAT** | `LISTCAT [LEVEL(prefix)] [NAMES \| ALL]` |
| **PRINT** | `PRINT INFILE(cluster) [CHARACTER \| HEX \| DUMP] [COUNT(n)] [FROMKEY(k)] [TOKEY(k)]` |

Tokenisation is case-insensitive for keywords; values inside parens
(file names, keys) are taken verbatim. A trailing `-` on a line is
a continuation marker (JCL convention). Lines starting with `*` and
text bracketed by `/* … */` are comments.

#### Sequential file convention

`REPRO INFILE(…)` and `REPRO OUTFILE(…)` name files **relative to
`runtime_dir`** (`./runtime/` by default — see the `runtime_dir` knob
in `bricks.cnf`). Subdirectories are allowed, so an operator can keep
loads under `loads/`, dumps under `dumps/`, ad-hoc files under `tmp/`,
etc.:

```
REPRO INFILE(tmp/orders.in)         OUTFILE(ORDERS)         KEYS(7 0)
REPRO INFILE(loads/jan/customers.in) OUTFILE(CUSTOMERS)     KEYS(7 0)
REPRO INFILE(ORDERS)                OUTFILE(dumps/orders.dat)
```

Bricks treats a name with a `.` in it as a sequential file and a name
without one as a cluster, so subdirectory-bearing paths still pick LOAD
vs UNLOAD direction correctly as long as the seq side has an
extension. Each line of a sequential file becomes one record. The
`KEYS(len off)` clause carves the key out of those bytes (length first,
then offset — matching real IDCAMS); omit it and Bricks defaults to the
cluster's declared `KeyMax` from `DEFINE CLUSTER`.

**Parent directories are not auto-created.** Writing to
`OUTFILE(dumps/cust.dat)` when `runtime/dumps/` doesn't exist fails
cleanly — `mkdir -p runtime/dumps` on the host first.

#### Security

Operator-supplied paths are sandboxed to `runtime_dir`. The resolver
applies four independent traversal-defence layers before any file is
opened: a per-segment lexical filter (alphanumeric + `_-.` only,
rejects `..`, rejects leading-dot, rejects absolute paths and
backslashes), a `filepath.Clean` round-trip check, an absolute-prefix
invariant against `runtime_dir`, and a `filepath.EvalSymlinks` check
that rejects symlinks whose target leaves the sandbox. Attempts like
`INFILE(../etc/passwd)`, `INFILE(/etc/passwd)`, or `INFILE(symlink)`
where the symlink points outside the root all return `IDC3009I` with
condition code 8 and never reach `os.Open`. The IDCA transaction is
also admin-gated at the screen level; the path sandbox is defence in
depth on top of that.

#### Worked example

```
DEFINE CLUSTER (NAME(CUSTOMERS) RECORDSIZE(80 80) KEYS(7 0))
REPRO INFILE(tmp/customers.in) OUTFILE(CUSTOMERS) KEYS(7 0)
LISTCAT LEVEL(CUST)
PRINT INFILE(CUSTOMERS) CHARACTER COUNT(5)
```

`LISTCAT` produces a CEMT-style fixed-column listing:

```
CATALOG LISTING -- 1 ENTRY(S)
  NAME                 RECORDS  KEYMAX  RECMAX  LAST-MOD
  CUSTOMERS                 42       7      80  28May26 15:04
IDC0001I FUNCTION COMPLETED, CONDITION CODE IS 0
```

#### Condition codes

Same scale as classic IDCAMS:

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 0  | success |
| 4  | warning (e.g. duplicate records bypassed on REPRO, empty LISTCAT) |
| 8  | error (file not found, file locked by another terminal, DEFINE without REPLACE on an existing cluster) |
| 12 | severe (parse error, I/O failure) |

The highest code any single statement produced is reported on the
final `IDC0001I FUNCTION COMPLETED, HIGHEST CONDITION CODE WAS nn`
line.

#### Lock behaviour and concurrency

`DELETE` and `REPRO` (load mode) check the file's lock state before
proceeding. A file held under `EXEC CICS READ … UPDATE` by another
terminal is reported as `IDC3009I ** name LOCKED BY term=Txxxx, NOT
DELETED` with condition code 8 — the same refusal the CEDA VSAM
purge screen produces. Locks held by the operator's own terminal are
ignored (so a user can DELETE a file they themselves are mid-update
on, if they really want to).

Every IDCAMS command produces one line in the audit log
(`log/<timestamp>.log`):

```
idcams=DEFINE  target=CUSTOMERS term=T0001 user=admin status=OK detail="keymax=7 recmax=80"
idcams=REPRO   target=CUSTOMERS term=T0001 user=admin status=OK detail="source=customers.in records=42 skipped=0 dup=0"
idcams=DELETE  target=CUSTOMERS term=T0001 user=admin status=OK
```

#### Relationship to CEDA VSAM

`CEDA VSAM` and `IDCA` are two views of the same catalogue:

- **CEDA VSAM** — interactive table of every cluster with one-keystroke
  purge (`P` selector + secondary type-the-name confirmation). Use
  when you want to browse and purge a handful of files visually.
- **IDCA** — command-driven AMS. Use when you want to script a
  reproducible cluster lifecycle, declare metadata up front, or
  bulk-load from a sequential file.

Both go through the same audit logging and same lock checks; both
operate on the same `data/files.boltdb` buckets that `EXEC CICS WRITE`
populates from REXX and COBOL.

#### Offline IDCAMS — the `idcams` CLI

`idcams` is the **standalone** counterpart to the IDCA
transaction. Same engine, same control statements, same audit log
format — but it opens `data/files.boltdb` directly from the shell, so
the bricks region must be **stopped** while it runs. This is the
classic mainframe batch-IDCAMS model: shut the region down, run a
deck of DEFINE / REPRO / DELETE statements, bring the region back up.

```
idcams [-c bricks.cnf] [-d datadir] [-r runtimedir] -sysin deck.idcams
idcams [-c bricks.cnf] -e "DEFINE CLUSTER (NAME(X))"
idcams                                # reads SYSIN from stdin
```

Flags:

| Flag | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `-c <path>` | path to `bricks.cnf` (default: `./bricks.cnf` then `../bricks.cnf`) |
| `-d <dir>` | data directory holding `files.boltdb` (overrides `bricks.cnf`) |
| `-r <dir>` | `runtime_dir` sandbox root for REPRO INFILE/OUTFILE (overrides `bricks.cnf`) |
| `-sysin <file>` | read IDCAMS control statements from this file |
| `-e <stmt>` | execute one inline statement and exit |
| `-logdir <dir>` | audit-log directory (default: `bricks.cnf` `log_location`) |
| `-q` | suppress the SYSIN echo on stdout (listing only) |

**Exit code is the highest IDCAMS condition code** (0=OK, 4=warning,
8=error, 12=severe), so the CLI plugs into shell pipelines and CI
scripts directly. A REPRO that bypassed duplicate records exits 4; a
LISTCAT on an empty catalogue exits 4; a DELETE of a missing file
exits 8.

Worked example:

```
$ idcams -sysin reload.idcams
idcams — data=data  tmp=runtime/tmp  sysin=reload.idcams
------------------------------------------------------------------------
IDCAMS  SYSTEM SERVICES                                  BRICKS / KICKS
                                                  TIME: 14:21:08

   DEFINE CLUSTER (NAME(CUSTOMERS) RECORDSIZE(80 80) KEYS(7 0) REPLACE)
IDC0508I CLUSTER CUSTOMERS DEFINED  (KEYMAX=7, RECMAX=80)
IDC0001I FUNCTION COMPLETED, CONDITION CODE IS 0

   REPRO INFILE(customers.in) OUTFILE(CUSTOMERS) KEYS(7 0)
IDC0005I NUMBER OF RECORDS PROCESSED WAS 12450
IDC0001I FUNCTION COMPLETED, CONDITION CODE IS 0

IDC0001I FUNCTION COMPLETED, HIGHEST CONDITION CODE WAS 0
$ echo $?
0
```

If the bricks region is still running, the CLI detects the bbolt lock
contention and exits with code 16 plus a hint to use the IDCA
transaction instead — no hang, no partial write, no chance of
corrupting an in-flight region's view of the catalogue.

## Chapter 8. KSDS browse commands

A **browse** walks a CICS FILE in B+tree key order. The browse runs
inside a bbolt MVCC read transaction, so the cursor sees a stable
point-in-time snapshot — concurrent `WRITE` / `REWRITE` / `DELETE`
on the same FILE do not disturb an in-progress browse.

The browse is **per-task** and tied to one FILE. A program may have
multiple browses open on different FILEs at once; a second `STARTBR`
on the same FILE replaces the first (`STARTBR` is implicitly
idempotent in CICS).

The dispatcher releases any cursor the program forgot to `ENDBR` via
a `defer handler.CloseBrowses()` at task end.

> **Bricks deviation from IBM canonical:** browse cursors survive
> `SYNCPOINT`. Real CICS closes VSAM RPL browses at every
> `SYNCPOINT`; bricks browses are bbolt MVCC snapshots and remain
> valid until the matching `ENDBR` (or the dispatcher's task-end
> defer). Closing them at `SYNCPOINT` would be theater — the MVCC
> snapshot is already isolated from concurrent writers. This is
> what lets a `STARTBR` on `CECI` `PF5` #1 drive `READNEXT` on
> `PF5` #2 (each press is a per-PF5 implicit `SYNCPOINT`).

### STARTBR

Open a browse cursor on a KSDS file.

#### Format

```
EXEC CICS STARTBR FILE(name)
                 [RIDFLD(start)]
                 [GTEQ | EQUAL]
                 [GENERIC]
                 [KEYLENGTH(n)]
                 [REQID(handle)]
                 [RESP(var)] [RESP2(var)]
END-EXEC
```

`REQID(handle)` is the IBM-canonical concurrent-browse handle: a
program may hold several independent browses against the same
file by tagging each STARTBR / READNEXT / READPREV / ENDBR /
RESETBR with a distinct integer handle. Without `REQID` the
file's single default cursor is used — backward-compatible with
every existing bricks program.

#### Description

Opens a B+tree browse cursor on the file. With no `RIDFLD`, positions
on the first key. With `RIDFLD` and `GTEQ` (the IBM default and
bricks default), positions on the first key ≥ start. With `EQUAL`,
requires an exact match (`NOTFND` if absent). With `GENERIC` and
`KEYLENGTH(n)`, positions on (and walks only through) keys whose
first `n` bytes match the first `n` bytes of `RIDFLD`.

#### Options

**FILE(name)** *— required*

**RIDFLD(start)**
   Starting key. Default: first key in the file.

**GTEQ** | **EQUAL**
   Comparison rule. Default `GTEQ`.

**GENERIC**
   Restrict the walk to keys whose prefix matches.

**KEYLENGTH(n)**
   With `GENERIC`, the prefix length to match.

#### Conditions

| Condition | EIBRESP | Cause |
|---|---:|---|
| NORMAL | 0 | Cursor opened. |
| NOTFND | 13 | `EQUAL` requested but no such key. |
| INVREQ | 16 | Missing required option, invalid name, etc. |
| IOERR | 17 | Underlying store error. |

#### Example

```rexx
EXEC CICS STARTBR FILE('CUSTOMERS')
                 RIDFLD('NY-')
                 GENERIC KEYLENGTH(3)
END-EXEC
```

---

### READNEXT

Step the open browse cursor forward by one record.

#### Format

```
EXEC CICS READNEXT FILE(name)
                  {INTO(target) | SET(target)}
                  [RIDFLD(keyvar)]
                  [LENGTH(len)]
END-EXEC
```

#### Description

Advances the cursor and returns the next record (or the first record
if this is the first `READNEXT` after `STARTBR`). When `RIDFLD` is a
bare variable, the matching key is written back; when `LENGTH` is a
bare variable, the actual record length is written back.

Returns `ENDFILE` past the last key (or past the end of the
`GENERIC` prefix). Records that were deleted by a concurrent
transaction between `STARTBR` and the read are skipped automatically
(bounded forward loop, no goroutine-stack risk).

#### Options

**FILE(name)** *— required*

**INTO(target)** / **SET(target)** *— one required*

**RIDFLD(keyvar)**
   Receives the key of the record returned.

**LENGTH(len)**
   Receives the actual record length.

#### Bricks deviation from IBM canonical

`LENGTH(var)` on `READNEXT` (browse-family) is OUTPUT-only, not
input-as-max-buffer. Real CICS reads the caller's `LENGTH(var)` as
a cap on the bytes returned and writes back the actual size; bricks
ignores the input value and only writes back. The write-back-then-
read-as-input shape would otherwise corrupt subsequent reads in a
loop (`LENGTH(LEN)` on call 1 stores 4; call 2 caps a 13-byte
record to 4). The bricks KSDS store is fixed-size-per-record so
there is no operator-meaningful truncation here. A `LENGTH(20)`
literal on a 13-byte record returns the full 13 bytes (the literal
is silently ignored).

#### Conditions

| Condition | EIBRESP | Cause |
|---|---:|---|
| NORMAL | 0 | Record returned. |
| ENDFILE | 20 | Past the last key (or out of `GENERIC` prefix). |
| INVREQ | 16 | No `STARTBR` is open on this FILE. |
| IOERR | 17 | Underlying store error. |

#### Example

See `STARTBR` example, then:

```rexx
DO FOREVER
  EXEC CICS READNEXT FILE('CUSTOMERS') INTO(REC) RIDFLD(K) END-EXEC
  IF EIBRESP = 20 THEN LEAVE
  SAY K ':' REC
END
```

---

### READPREV

Step the open browse cursor backward by one record.

#### Format

```
EXEC CICS READPREV FILE(name)
                  {INTO(target) | SET(target)}
                  [RIDFLD(keyvar)]
                  [LENGTH(len)]
END-EXEC
```

#### Description

Same writeback rules as `READNEXT`. Returns `ENDFILE` before the
first key (or before the start of the `GENERIC` prefix). Useful for
paginating backward through a key range.

#### Options

As for `READNEXT`.

#### Bricks deviation from IBM canonical

Same shape as `READNEXT`: `LENGTH(var)` is OUTPUT-only, not
input-as-max-buffer. The write-back-then-read-as-input pattern
would corrupt subsequent reads in a backward walk; bricks ignores
the operator-supplied input value and only writes back the actual
record size. Real VSAM variable-length permits LENGTH-as-max-
buffer; the bricks KSDS-fixed model has no operator-meaningful
truncation here.

#### Conditions

As for `READNEXT`, with `ENDFILE` meaning *before the first key*.

#### Example

```rexx
EXEC CICS READPREV FILE('CUSTOMERS') INTO(REC) RIDFLD(K) END-EXEC
```

---

### RESETBR

Reposition the cursor of an open browse without closing the
underlying read transaction.

#### Format

```
EXEC CICS RESETBR FILE(name)
                 RIDFLD(start)
                 [GTEQ | EQUAL]
                 [GENERIC]
                 [KEYLENGTH(n)]
END-EXEC
```

#### Description

Cheaper than `ENDBR + STARTBR` when the program wants to jump within
the same browse session — the read snapshot is preserved.

#### Options

As for `STARTBR`. `RIDFLD` is required.

#### Conditions

| Condition | EIBRESP | Cause |
|---|---:|---|
| NORMAL | 0 | Cursor repositioned. |
| INVREQ | 16 | No `STARTBR` is open on this FILE. |
| NOTFND | 13 | `EQUAL` requested but no such key. |

#### Example

```rexx
EXEC CICS RESETBR FILE('CUSTOMERS') RIDFLD('00500') END-EXEC
```

---

### ENDBR

Close an open browse cursor.

#### Format

```
EXEC CICS ENDBR FILE(name)
END-EXEC
```

#### Description

Releases the cursor and the underlying bbolt read transaction. The
dispatcher releases any cursor the program forgot to `ENDBR` at task
end, but explicit `ENDBR` is recommended.

#### Options

**FILE(name)** *— required*

#### Conditions

| Condition | EIBRESP | Cause |
|---|---:|---|
| NORMAL | 0 | Cursor closed. |
| INVREQ | 16 | No `STARTBR` is open on this FILE. |

#### Example

```rexx
EXEC CICS ENDBR FILE('CUSTOMERS') END-EXEC
```

## Chapter 8a. File Control on `tmp_dir` Sequential Files

The browse verbs in Chapter 8 (`STARTBR` / `READNEXT` / `READPREV` /
`RESETBR` / `ENDBR`) and the direct positional `READ FILE … RIDFLD`
also operate on **sequential files** living in the `tmp_dir`
sandbox — the same files `READQ TD` / `WRITEQ TD` and the REXX
`LINEIN` / `LINEOUT` family read and write. The routing is transparent
and existence-based: if `tmp_dir/<name>` exists, the browse verbs use
the line-record / RBA-keyed sequential backend; otherwise they fall
through to the KSDS bbolt store (Chapter 8). When the same name is
present in BOTH back-ends, the sequential file wins on `STARTBR`, and
bricks logs a `WARN` line at startup so the operator knows the routing.

Use this chapter when the program needs **non-FIFO** access to a
sequential file — random-access reads by byte offset, backward
walks, or jumping to a known position with `RESETBR`. Pure FIFO
consumption stays cheapest via `READQ TD` (Chapter 9).

### RBA semantics

The Relative Byte Address (RBA) is the **decimal byte offset of the
start of a record**, expressed as plain ASCII text — consistent with
`READQ TS NUMITEMS` and the rest of the bricks numeric conventions.
A three-line file `"line1\nline2\nline3\n"` (each line is 5 bytes
plus the LF terminator) has records at RBA 0, 6, and 12.

Bricks deviation from IBM canonical: real CICS ESDS exposes RBA as a
4-byte fullword (`PIC S9(8) COMP`). Bricks renders it as decimal text
so REXX programs and COBOL `PIC X(n)` host variables both see a
value they can arithmetic on without datatype conversion. The
deviation is called out here and in `README.md` so a porter from a
z/OS shop isn't surprised.

`STARTBR` (and `RESETBR`) with an RBA that falls **mid-line** rounds
backward to the prior LF+1 so the next `READNEXT` returns the
**containing** record rather than a garbled split. Mid-line `RIDFLD`
on a direct `READ FILE … RIDFLD(rba)` rounds the same way. This
matches the operator's mental model: "the byte I named lives inside
record X; give me X."

### Record boundary

Records terminate with a single LF (`0x0A`). The LF is excluded from
the `INTO(area)` payload. A trailing line without LF is returned
once; the next `READNEXT` returns `ENDFILE`. The byte-level encoding
is the same as Chapter 9's TD queues — see "[The `tmp_dir`
sandbox](#the-tmp_dir-sandbox)" for the strict ASCII rule.

Bricks deviation: real ESDS uses an RDW (Record Descriptor Word) or
fixed-length records, not LF-terminated lines. Bricks aligns the
sequential format with the rest of the tmp_dir contract (REXX
`LINEIN`, COBOL `READQ TD`) so one file is portable across all
three I/O surfaces.

### Verb subset

| Verb | Supported? | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `STARTBR` | yes | `RIDFLD` optional — defaults to BOF (= RBA 0). `EQUAL`, `GENERIC`, `KEYLENGTH` rejected with INVREQ. |
| `READNEXT` | yes | Returns next line; RIDFLD writeback = decimal RBA. |
| `READPREV` | yes | Walks backward; same RBA conventions. |
| `RESETBR` | yes | RIDFLD parsed as decimal RBA; backward-rounds same as STARTBR. |
| `ENDBR` | yes | Releases the FD. |
| `READ FILE … RIDFLD(rba)` | yes | One-shot positional read; LENGTH semantics same as READNEXT. |
| `UNLOCK FILE` | yes | No-op accepted (bricks has no record locks). |
| `WRITE FILE` | **no** — INVREQ "use WRITEQ TD" | |
| `REWRITE FILE` | **no** — INVREQ "use WRITEQ TD" | |
| `DELETE FILE` | **no** — INVREQ "use DELETEQ TD" | |

### LENGTH semantics (divergence from KSDS!)

On KSDS browse verbs (Chapter 8), `LENGTH(var)` is **output-only** —
the store decides record size and writes it back to `var`. The
recent KSDS fix made this explicit: treating LENGTH-on-READNEXT as
an INPUT bound triggered the write-back-then-read-as-input bug that
truncated record 2 to the length of record 1.

On `tmp_dir` sequential files, `LENGTH(var)` is **INPUT bound +
OUTPUT actual** — the program's declared buffer capacity is
honoured. If the record exceeds the buffer, the verb returns
`LENGERR`, truncates the payload to the buffer size, and writes the
**actual** (untruncated) record length back to `var`. The "actual
not truncated" rule is the canonical real-CICS LENGERR semantic so
a program can see how much was lost.

```rexx
LEN = 80                              /* buffer cap */
EXEC CICS READNEXT FILE('orders.txt') INTO(REC) RIDFLD(K) LENGTH(LEN) END-EXEC
IF EIBRESP = 22 THEN                  /* LENGERR */
   SAY 'Record was' LEN 'bytes; lost' (LEN - 80) 'bytes after truncation'
```

### RESP / RESP2 mapping

| Condition | EIBRESP | Cause |
|---|---:|---|
| NORMAL | 0 | Record returned (or `ENDBR` succeeded). |
| INVREQ | 16 | `EQUAL` / `GENERIC` / `KEYLENGTH` on sequential file; bad RBA (negative, parse failure); `WRITE` / `REWRITE` / `DELETE` against a tmp_dir name; missing `STARTBR` cursor. |
| LENGERR | 22 | Record exceeded `LENGTH(var)` buffer; payload truncated. Actual length writeback. |
| NOTFND | 13 | File not present in tmp_dir at `READ FILE … RIDFLD(rba)`, or `STARTBR` opened OK but the RBA landed past EOF on the next `READNEXT`. Real-CICS `FILENOTFOUND` (RESP=12) is not separately surfaced; programs already test for NOTFND. |
| ENDFILE | 20 | `READNEXT` past end, or `READPREV` past beginning. (Both directions reuse one constant — matches real CICS.) |
| IOERR | 17 | Filesystem error (rare; the sandbox is local-only). |

### Interaction with `WRITEQ TD` mid-browse

Bricks's sequential backend is single-FD-per-cursor. When a
concurrent task issues `WRITEQ TD` against the **same file** while
this task holds a `STARTBR` open, the appended bytes ARE picked up:
on each `READNEXT` whose internal position has reached the size we
captured at `STARTBR`, the cursor re-`Stat`s the file descriptor.
If the file has grown, the new bytes flow into the next `READNEXT`;
otherwise, `ENDFILE` is returned as normal.

This is a documented deviation — real CICS holds a transient view
of the dataset at `STARTBR` time and does not see mid-browse
writes. Bricks chose the "moving target" rule so a long-running
report transaction can stream a file that's still being written by
a feeder task.

### Real-CICS-veteran gotchas

* **RBA-is-decimal-text** — not a 4-byte `COMP` fullword. A REXX
  variable receiving RBA is a plain string; arithmetic works
  directly.
* **Record boundary is LF**, not a fixed-length record or RDW. A
  binary-mode browse is out of scope today.
* **STARTBR without RIDFLD** = BOF. Real CICS requires `RIDFLD`.
* **Browses survive `SYNCPOINT`** — same deviation already
  documented for KSDS (Chapter 8). Released by `ENDBR` or by the
  dispatcher's defer at task end.
* **Mid-browse writes are visible** via Stat-refresh-on-EOF. Real
  CICS doesn't do this.

---

## Chapter 9. Temporary storage and transient data commands

Bricks supports two related queue families:

* **Temporary Storage (TS)** — ordered, persistent sequences of
  opaque byte items inside the bbolt database. Each queue is a
  sub-bucket whose keys are 8-byte big-endian item numbers (1, 2, 3
  …) and whose values are the item payloads. Item-addressed; reads
  and writes are O(log N). Use for ephemeral state, scratch
  storage, producer/consumer chaining inside the database.

* **Transient Data extra-partition (TD)** — sequential text files
  in a sandboxed on-disk directory (`tmp_dir`). Line-oriented;
  read-once-and-advance / append-only semantics. Use for staging
  imports from text files into VSAM and exports out of it. The
  REXX `LINEIN` / `LINEOUT` / `STREAM` family hits the same
  backend, so a file written by COBOL is readable by REXX and
  vice-versa.

The encoding contract for TD files is strict: ASCII bytes only
(`0x09` TAB, `0x20`–`0x7E` printable), no EBCDIC, no UTF; lines are
terminated by a single LF (`0x0A`); CR (`0x0D`) is rejected on write
with `INVREQ`. The sandbox enforces a flat namespace under
`tmp_dir` — no sub-directories, no leading dot, no `..`, no slashes
in the queue name. See [The `tmp_dir` sandbox](#the-tmp_dir-sandbox)
below for the full rules.

### READQ TS

Read an item from a temporary storage queue.

#### Format

```
EXEC CICS READQ TS QUEUE(name)
                  INTO(target)
                  [ITEM(n) | NEXT]
                  [LENGTH(len)]
                  [NUMITEMS(num)]
END-EXEC
```

`QNAME` is accepted as a synonym for `QUEUE`.

#### Description

`READQ TS` runs in one of two modes:

1. **Cursor mode** — advance the **per-task implicit cursor**: the
   first cursor-less READQ on a queue returns item 1, the second
   returns item 2, and so on. The cursor is keyed on the running
   TxCB and released when the task ends — a fresh invocation of the
   same TRANSID starts at item 1 again.

2. **Explicit-item mode** — `ITEM(n)` reads that exact item without
   touching the cursor. Useful for random-access reads where the
   program knows the item number in advance.

The mode is selected by IBM-canonical strict semantics. Cursor mode
fires when `NEXT` is present OR when `ITEM` is absent. Explicit-item
mode fires when `ITEM(n)` is present without `NEXT`; the variable's
current value names the item to read and must be a positive integer.
The four operator patterns are:

```
READQ TS QUEUE(q) INTO(d)                   — cursor mode; item number not returned
READQ TS QUEUE(q) INTO(d) NEXT              — cursor mode; same as above
READQ TS QUEUE(q) INTO(d) NEXT ITEM(N)      — cursor mode; writes item number to N
READQ TS QUEUE(q) INTO(d) ITEM(N)           — explicit mode; N must be a positive integer input
```

> **Bricks deviation from IBM canonical:** the per-task implicit
> cursor survives `SYNCPOINT`. Real CICS clears the read cursor on
> recoverable TSQs at every SYNCPOINT; bricks does not. The bricks
> design treats `SYNCPOINT` as a unit-of-work commit boundary that
> does not touch cursor state, browse cursors, TD handles, WEB
> sessions, or DOCUMENT tokens. This is what lets a `CECI` operator
> walk a queue across `PF5` presses (each press is a per-PF5
> implicit `SYNCPOINT`), and what lets a long-running REXX program
> issue periodic `SYNCPOINT`s without rewinding its read loop.

#### Options

**QUEUE(name)** / **QNAME(name)** *— required*

**INTO(target)** *— required*

**ITEM(n)** | **NEXT**
   `NEXT` (or `ITEM` absent) selects cursor mode. `ITEM(n)` without
   `NEXT` is **strict input**: the variable must hold a positive
   integer or `INVREQ` fires with a short error pointing the
   operator at `NEXT`. `NEXT ITEM(var)` is the cursor-loop form —
   the resolved item number is written back into `var` on success.

**LENGTH(len)**
   Receives the actual item length.

**NUMITEMS(num)**
   Receives the queue's current high-water item count.

#### Conditions

| Condition | EIBRESP | Cause |
|---|---:|---|
| NORMAL | 0 | Item returned. |
| ITEMERR | 26 | `ITEM(n)` out of range, or implicit cursor past the last item. |
| QIDERR | 44 | Queue does not exist. |
| INVREQ | 16 | Missing required option, invalid name, or `ITEM(var)` (no `NEXT`) when `var` is unset / non-numeric. |

#### Example

```rexx
DO FOREVER
  EXEC CICS READQ TS QUEUE(QNM) INTO(REC) NEXT END-EXEC
  IF EIBRESP = 26 THEN LEAVE                /* end of queue */
  SAY REC
END
```

---

### WRITEQ TS

Append a new item to a queue, or rewrite an existing item.

#### Format

```
EXEC CICS WRITEQ TS QUEUE(name)
                   FROM(data)
                   [ITEM(n) REWRITE]
                   [NUMITEMS(var)]
                   [MAIN | AUXILIARY]
                   [RESP(var)] [RESP2(var)]
END-EXEC
```

`QNAME` is accepted as a synonym for `QUEUE`. `NUMITEMS(var)`
receives the queue's current item count after the write — IBM
canonical; lets programs drive paging without a follow-up READQ.
`MAIN` and `AUXILIARY` are storage-class hints from real CICS;
bricks uses a uniform bbolt-backed store so both are accepted
silently.

#### Description

In **append** mode (no `ITEM REWRITE`), the item is added at the next
sequence number; an in-memory high-water-mark counter assigns the
number without scanning. When `ITEM(var)` is a bare variable, the
assigned item number is written back.

In **rewrite** mode (both `ITEM(n)` and `REWRITE` present), item `n`
is replaced.

The write commits in a single bbolt transaction so a crash mid-write
leaves either the prior state or the new one — never a partial.

#### Options

**QUEUE(name)** / **QNAME(name)** *— required*
**FROM(data)** *— required*
**ITEM(n) REWRITE**
   Both required for rewrite mode; either alone is rejected.

#### Conditions

| Condition | EIBRESP | Cause |
|---|---:|---|
| NORMAL | 0 | Item written. |
| ITEMERR | 26 | `ITEM(n) REWRITE` and item `n` does not exist. |
| INVREQ | 16 | Missing required option, invalid name, or `ITEM`/`REWRITE` not paired. |
| IOERR | 17 | Underlying store error. |

#### Example

```rexx
EXEC CICS WRITEQ TS QUEUE('AUDIT') FROM(MSG) ITEM(I) END-EXEC
SAY 'Wrote item' I
```

---

### DELETEQ TS

Delete an entire temporary storage queue.

#### Format

```
EXEC CICS DELETEQ TS QUEUE(name) END-EXEC
```

#### Description

Drops the queue's sub-bucket and resets the in-memory counters and
cursors. Subsequent `WRITEQ` will recreate it starting at item 1.

#### Options

**QUEUE(name)** / **QNAME(name)** *— required*

#### Conditions

| Condition | EIBRESP | Cause |
|---|---:|---|
| NORMAL | 0 | Queue deleted. |
| QIDERR | 44 | Queue does not exist. |

#### Example

```rexx
EXEC CICS DELETEQ TS QUEUE('AUDIT') END-EXEC
```

---

### READQ TD

Read the next line from a sequential text file in `tmp_dir`.

> **Need non-FIFO access?** `READQ TD` is the cheapest read for plain
> forward-sequential consumption. When the program needs random
> access by byte offset, backward walks, or repositioning by RBA on
> the same file, switch to the browse verbs against the same
> `tmp_dir` name — see [Chapter 8a. File Control on `tmp_dir`
> Sequential Files](#chapter-8a-file-control-on-tmp_dir-sequential-files).
> Both verbs read the same on-disk bytes, so a file written via
> `WRITEQ TD` is immediately browsable via `STARTBR`.

#### Format

```
EXEC CICS READQ TD QUEUE(name)
                  INTO(target)
                  [LENGTH(len)]
END-EXEC
```

`QNAME` is accepted as a synonym for `QUEUE`. `name` is a flat
filename under `tmp_dir`; sub-directories and traversal are rejected
with `INVREQ`.

#### Description

Reads the next LF-terminated line from `tmp_dir/name`, strips the
terminating LF, and copies the payload into `target`. The file is
auto-opened in read mode on the first call per task and the read
cursor advances item-by-item across subsequent calls. A program that
WRITEs then READs the same queue causes the handler to close the
write handle and reopen for read; the read cursor restarts at line
1. The handle is closed automatically at task end.

#### Options

**QUEUE(name)** / **QNAME(name)** *— required*

**INTO(target)** *— required*

**LENGTH(len)**
   Receives the line's byte count (after the LF strip).

#### Conditions

| Condition | EIBRESP | Cause |
|---|---:|---|
| NORMAL | 0 | Line returned. |
| QZERO | 12 | End-of-file. `target` is untouched; bricks closes the handle so a later READQ on the same queue rewinds to line 1. |
| QIDERR | 44 | File does not exist in `tmp_dir`. |
| INVREQ | 16 | Missing `INTO` / invalid name / sandbox rejection. |
| IOERR | 17 | Underlying file-system error. |

#### Example

```cobol
PERFORM IMPORT-ONE UNTIL DONE-FLAG = 'Y'.
...
IMPORT-ONE.
    MOVE SPACES TO REC.
    EXEC CICS READQ TD QUEUE('orders.sample.txt') INTO(REC) END-EXEC.
    IF EIBRESP = 12 THEN
        MOVE 'Y' TO DONE-FLAG
    END-IF.
    IF EIBRESP = 0 THEN
        PERFORM HANDLE-RECORD
    END-IF.
```

---

### WRITEQ TD

Append a line to a sequential text file in `tmp_dir`.

#### Format

```
EXEC CICS WRITEQ TD QUEUE(name)
                   FROM(data)
                   [LENGTH(len)]
END-EXEC
```

`QNAME` is accepted as a synonym for `QUEUE`.

#### Description

Appends `data` plus a single LF to `tmp_dir/name`. The file is
auto-opened in append mode (creating it if absent) on the first
call per task. Trailing ASCII spaces on `data` are right-stripped
before write — COBOL `PIC X(n)` values arrive padded to the right
and the canonical text-file convention is to strip them. The
payload is validated byte-by-byte: anything outside `0x09` (TAB),
`0x0A` (LF), or `0x20`–`0x7E` (printable ASCII) causes the write
to fail with `INVREQ` and a byte-offset diagnostic. CR (`0x0D`) is
explicitly rejected — bricks emits Unix-style LF-only files.

#### Options

**QUEUE(name)** / **QNAME(name)** *— required*

**FROM(data)** *— required*

**LENGTH(len)**
   Accepted for syntactic compatibility; the actual byte count is
   `LENGTH(data)` after rstrip.

#### Conditions

| Condition | EIBRESP | Cause |
|---|---:|---|
| NORMAL | 0 | Line appended. |
| INVREQ | 16 | Missing `FROM` / invalid name / sandbox rejection / non-ASCII byte / CR in payload. |
| IOERR | 17 | Underlying file-system error. |

#### Example

```rexx
DO I = 1 TO REC.0
   EXEC CICS WRITEQ TD QUEUE('export.txt') FROM(REC.I) END-EXEC
END
```

---

### DELETEQ TD

Delete a sequential text file in `tmp_dir`.

#### Format

```
EXEC CICS DELETEQ TD QUEUE(name) END-EXEC
```

#### Description

Closes any handle the task has open on `name`, then unlinks the
file. Already-gone is treated as success (matches the `DELETE FILE`
forgiving semantics in bricks). Use to reset an export staging file
before a fresh batch.

#### Conditions

| Condition | EIBRESP | Cause |
|---|---:|---|
| NORMAL | 0 | File deleted (or already absent). |
| INVREQ | 16 | Invalid name / sandbox rejection. |
| IOERR | 17 | Underlying file-system error. |

#### Example

```cobol
EXEC CICS DELETEQ TD QUEUE('export.txt') END-EXEC.
```

---

### The `tmp_dir` sandbox

`tmp_dir` is configured in `bricks.cnf`:

```
tmp_dir = runtime/tmp
```

Defaults to `runtime/tmp` (under `runtime_dir`) when the line is
omitted. The directory is created at startup if missing.

**Name rules.** A queue name must match `[A-Za-z0-9._-]{1,255}` —
no leading dot, no `..`, no slash, no backslash, no NUL. Bricks
also runs `filepath.Rel` against every resolved path as
defense-in-depth, so symlink shenanigans bounce too.

**Encoding rules.** ASCII only — no EBCDIC, no UTF-8, no UTF-16.
The write path validates every byte and rejects with `INVREQ` on
the first violation, naming the offending offset and hex value.
Lines terminate with LF only; CR is rejected on write. The read
path splits on LF and preserves any CR bytes it finds verbatim —
bricks does **not** silently strip them. If you need to import a
file authored on Windows, pre-strip the CRs:

```
tr -d '\r' < windows.csv > runtime/tmp/clean.csv
```

**Cross-language interop.** Both COBOL (`READQ TD` / `WRITEQ TD`)
and REXX (`LINEIN` / `LINEOUT` / `STREAM`) hit the same
`*cics.TmpStore` backend. A file produced by one language is
readable by the other; the only constraint is that both sides
agree on the column format inside each line (canonical bricks
convention: pipe-delimited).

**Task-end cleanup.** Every handle the program opens is closed
automatically when the task ends. A program that forgets to call
`STREAM CLOSE` or `DELETEQ TD` does not leak descriptors.

---

## Chapter 10. Recovery and condition handling

This chapter covers two related families:

* **Unit-of-work commands** — `SYNCPOINT` and `SYNCPOINT ROLLBACK`
  group multiple file / TS mutations into one atomic step that can
  be committed or undone.
* **Non-local control commands** — `HANDLE CONDITION`,
  `IGNORE CONDITION`, `HANDLE AID`, and `HANDLE ABEND` arm program
  labels that the dispatcher branches to on a non-`NORMAL` response,
  on a particular AID key, or when the task abends. Together with
  the per-call `EIBRESP` test ([Chapter 12](#chapter-12-response-codes))
  and REXX `SIGNAL ON ERROR` ([Chapter 18](#chapter-18-conditions-and-signal-on))
  they cover the full range of CICS error-handling idioms.

### How the unit of work works

Each task owns a **journal** of pending undo entries that lives on
its `TxCB`. Every successful `WRITE` / `REWRITE` / `DELETE` and every
`WRITEQ TS` / `DELETEQ TS` appends an inverse operation to the
journal *immediately after* the underlying bbolt write commits.

* `SYNCPOINT` clears the journal — the work becomes irrevocably
  committed, and a new unit of work begins.
* `SYNCPOINT ROLLBACK` walks the journal in reverse and applies each
  inverse op (re-writing pre-images, re-creating deleted records,
  restoring queue contents, etc.), then clears the journal.
* `RETURN` performs an **implicit `SYNCPOINT`** before the task ends.
* `ABEND` performs an **implicit `SYNCPOINT ROLLBACK`** *unless* a
  `HANDLE ABEND` exit catches it; the exit may then choose whether
  to commit or roll back explicitly.

In-flight uncommitted writes are visible to concurrent tasks (this
matches IBM CICS under `READ NO UPDATE`); the rollback model exists
to recover *the current task* from its own partially-applied work,
not to provide multi-task isolation.

### How the condition / AID / abend traps work

After every `EXEC CICS` command, the dispatcher writes `EIBRESP` and
then consults three optional per-task tables:

| Table | Populated by | Consulted | Branches when |
|---|---|---|---|
| Condition map | `HANDLE CONDITION` / `IGNORE CONDITION` | After every command | `EIBRESP ≠ NORMAL` and a label is armed for that condition (or for `ERROR`). |
| AID map | `HANDLE AID` | After every command that updates `EIBAID` (`SEND MAP`, `RECEIVE MAP`, `RECEIVE`) | The new `EIBAID` matches an armed key (`PF1`–`PF24`, `PA1`–`PA3`, `ENTER`, `CLEAR`, or the catch-all `ANYKEY`). |
| Abend exit | `HANDLE ABEND` | When the task abends | An exit is armed and not cancelled. |

When a trap fires, control transfers to the named label as if the
program had `GO TO`'d (COBOL) or `SIGNAL`'d (REXX) it directly. The
trap *stays armed* across the branch — re-arming after each fire is
not required (and the `IGNORE` / bare-name disarm forms exist for
when the program wants the trap to stop firing).

---

### SYNCPOINT

Commit the current unit of work and begin a new one.

#### Format

```
EXEC CICS SYNCPOINT END-EXEC
```

#### Description

Clears the task's undo journal. All file / TS writes performed since
the last `SYNCPOINT` (or since the task began) are made permanent;
they can no longer be rolled back. A fresh, empty journal is started
and subsequent mutations accumulate against it.

`SYNCPOINT` is implicit on `EXEC CICS RETURN` — programs that run
to completion never need to call it explicitly. The explicit form is
useful in long-running tasks that want to checkpoint partial
progress, or in programs that mix recoverable phases with phases
where rollback is no longer meaningful.

#### Options

None.

#### Conditions

| Condition | EIBRESP | Cause |
|---|---:|---|
| NORMAL | 0 | Journal cleared. |

`SYNCPOINT` cannot fail in bricks because the underlying bbolt
writes have already committed by the time the journal entry was
appended.

#### Example

```cobol
*  Phase 1: build the audit row, commit immediately so a later
*  validation failure does not undo the audit trail.
EXEC CICS WRITEQ TS QUEUE('AUDIT') FROM(WS-LOG) END-EXEC.
EXEC CICS SYNCPOINT END-EXEC.

*  Phase 2: real business work; rolled back if validation fails.
EXEC CICS REWRITE FILE('CUSTOMERS') FROM(WS-CUST) END-EXEC.
IF WS-INVALID
   EXEC CICS SYNCPOINT ROLLBACK END-EXEC
   EXEC CICS ABEND ABCODE('VAL1') END-EXEC
END-IF.
```

---

### SYNCPOINT ROLLBACK

Discard the current unit of work and begin a new one.

#### Format

```
EXEC CICS SYNCPOINT ROLLBACK END-EXEC
```

#### Description

Walks the task's undo journal in reverse and applies each inverse
operation:

* `WRITE` is undone by deleting the new key.
* `REWRITE` is undone by re-writing the captured pre-image.
* `DELETE` is undone by re-writing the deleted record.
* `WRITEQ TS` (append) is undone by deleting the appended item.
* `WRITEQ TS ... REWRITE` is undone by re-writing the pre-image.
* `DELETEQ TS` is undone by restoring every prior item from a
  snapshot taken before the delete.

After the walk the journal is cleared and a new unit of work begins.

`ROLLBACK` is implicit when `EXEC CICS ABEND` runs **without** a
`HANDLE ABEND` exit. When an exit *does* intercept the abend, the
exit code decides whether to call `SYNCPOINT ROLLBACK` (typical) or
`SYNCPOINT` (commit partial work and continue).

#### Options

`ROLLBACK` is the only option — it is what distinguishes this form
from plain `SYNCPOINT`.

#### Conditions

| Condition | EIBRESP | Cause |
|---|---:|---|
| NORMAL | 0 | All journal entries successfully reverted. |
| ROLLEDBACK | 82 | One or more inverse ops failed (the underlying bbolt error is logged). The journal is still cleared; some writes may remain partially undone. |

#### Example

```rexx
ADDRESS CICS

EXEC CICS WRITE FILE('ACCT') RIDFLD(DEBIT_ID)  FROM(DEBIT_REC)  END-EXEC
EXEC CICS WRITE FILE('ACCT') RIDFLD(CREDIT_ID) FROM(CREDIT_REC) END-EXEC

IF DEBIT_TOTAL <> CREDIT_TOTAL THEN DO
   EXEC CICS SYNCPOINT ROLLBACK END-EXEC      /* both writes undone */
   EXEC CICS ABEND ABCODE('IMBL') END-EXEC
END

EXEC CICS SYNCPOINT END-EXEC                  /* commit both writes */
```

---

### HANDLE CONDITION

Arm program labels to receive control on named EXEC CICS conditions.

#### Format

```
EXEC CICS HANDLE CONDITION cond1[(label)] cond2[(label)] ...
END-EXEC
```

#### Description

Builds a per-task map from condition name to label. After every
EXEC CICS command, when `EIBRESP ≠ NORMAL`, the dispatcher consults
the map:

1. If the *exact* condition name is armed, control branches to the
   named label.
2. Otherwise, if the catch-all `ERROR` is armed, control branches
   to that label.
3. Otherwise, the response code is left in `EIBRESP` for the
   program to test, exactly as if `HANDLE CONDITION` had never been
   issued.

The `(label)` form arms the trap; the bare condition name (no
parens) **disarms** it. Arming a previously-armed condition replaces
the old label.

`HANDLE CONDITION` is the legacy CICS error-handling style.
Modern programs that use `RESP(rc)` style (or REXX `SIGNAL ON ERROR`)
do not need it; the two styles can coexist within the same program
because both ultimately read `EIBRESP`.

#### Options

**condN(label)**
   Arm `condN` (one of the names in [Chapter 12. Response codes](#chapter-12-response-codes),
   e.g. `NOTFND`, `DUPREC`, `MAPFAIL`, `INVREQ`, `IOERR`, `LENGERR`,
   `QIDERR`, `ITEMERR`, `ENDFILE`, `PGMIDERR`, `EOC`) so it
   branches to `label`.

**condN** *(no parens)*
   Disarm `condN`.

**ERROR(label)**
   Arm a catch-all that fires for any non-`NORMAL` response not
   matched by a more specific arm.

A single `HANDLE CONDITION` may combine any number of arm and
disarm options.

#### Conditions

| Condition | EIBRESP | Cause |
|---|---:|---|
| NORMAL | 0 | Map updated. |
| INVREQ | 16 | Unknown condition name. |

#### Example

```rexx
ADDRESS CICS

EXEC CICS HANDLE CONDITION NOTFND(NOREC)
                           DUPREC(DUP)
                           ERROR(OOPS)
END-EXEC

EXEC CICS READ FILE('CUSTOMERS') INTO(REC) RIDFLD(CKEY) END-EXEC
SAY 'Found:' REC
EXIT

NOREC: SAY 'No customer with key' CKEY; EXIT 4
DUP:   SAY 'Duplicate key on insert';  EXIT 8
OOPS:  SAY 'Other CICS error, RC=' EIBRESP; EXIT 12
```

---

### IGNORE CONDITION

Suppress the `HANDLE CONDITION` trap for one or more conditions.

#### Format

```
EXEC CICS IGNORE CONDITION cond1 cond2 ...
END-EXEC
```

#### Description

Marks each named condition as *ignored*: even if `HANDLE CONDITION`
previously armed it, the trap will no longer fire and the program
must test `EIBRESP` itself. `IGNORE CONDITION` stays in effect until
a later `HANDLE CONDITION cond(label)` re-arms the same condition.

The distinction between *unarmed* (never armed, or disarmed by the
bare-name form) and *ignored* matters only when `ERROR(label)` is
armed: an unarmed condition still falls through to `ERROR`, but an
ignored one does not.

#### Options

Each operand is a bare condition name — no parentheses, no label.
Multiple conditions may be combined in a single call.

#### Conditions

| Condition | EIBRESP | Cause |
|---|---:|---|
| NORMAL | 0 | Map updated. |
| INVREQ | 16 | Unknown condition name. |

#### Example

```cobol
EXEC CICS HANDLE CONDITION ERROR(BADIO) END-EXEC.

*  We *expect* NOTFND on this READ — don't trip the ERROR trap.
EXEC CICS IGNORE CONDITION NOTFND END-EXEC.

EXEC CICS READ FILE('CUSTOMERS') INTO(WS-REC) RIDFLD(WS-KEY) END-EXEC.
IF EIBRESP = 13
   PERFORM CREATE-NEW-CUSTOMER
END-IF.
```

---

### HANDLE AID

Arm program labels to receive control on a particular attention key.

#### Format

```
EXEC CICS HANDLE AID key1[(label)] key2[(label)] ...
END-EXEC
```

#### Description

Builds a per-task map from AID byte to label. After any command
that updates `EIBAID` (`SEND MAP`, `RECEIVE MAP`, `RECEIVE`),
the dispatcher consults the map and branches if the new `EIBAID`
matches an armed key.

The bare key name (no parens) disarms a previously-armed key.
`ANYKEY` is a catch-all matched by any AID for which no specific
arm exists.

#### Options

**keyN(label)** / **keyN**
   `keyN` is one of `ENTER`, `CLEAR`, `PA1`–`PA3`, `PF1`–`PF24`, or
   `ANYKEY`. Parenthesised arms the trap; bare disarms it.

#### Conditions

| Condition | EIBRESP | Cause |
|---|---:|---|
| NORMAL | 0 | Map updated. |
| INVREQ | 16 | Unknown AID name. |

#### Example

```rexx
ADDRESS CICS

EXEC CICS HANDLE AID PF3(QUIT) PF12(QUIT) CLEAR(QUIT) END-EXEC

DO FOREVER
   EXEC CICS RECEIVE MAP('CUST1') INTO(SCR.) END-EXEC
   ... process ...
   EXEC CICS SEND MAP('CUST1') FROM(SCR.) ERASE END-EXEC
END

QUIT:
   EXEC CICS RETURN END-EXEC
```

### HANDLE ABEND

Arm a program-level abend exit.

#### Format

```
EXEC CICS HANDLE ABEND { LABEL(label) | PROGRAM(name) | CANCEL | RESET }
END-EXEC
```

#### Description

Registers an exit that runs when the task abends (either via
`EXEC CICS ABEND` or via an unhandled runtime error). The exit
*replaces* the implicit `SYNCPOINT ROLLBACK` that an uncaught
abend would perform — it is now the exit's responsibility to call
`SYNCPOINT` or `SYNCPOINT ROLLBACK` explicitly.

`EIBABCODE` is set to the abend code (default `AAAA`) before the
exit receives control.

#### Options

**LABEL(label)**
   Branch to `label` within the current program when the task abends.
   This is the form REXX programs almost always use.

**PROGRAM(name)**
   `XCTL` to the named program when the task abends. Currently
   accepted by the parser; the runtime treats `PROGRAM(name)` as
   equivalent to `LABEL(name)` (i.e. it branches inside the current
   program rather than transferring control).

**CANCEL**
   Disarm the current exit and restore the previous one (one level
   of nesting is preserved).

**RESET**
   Re-enable an exit previously suspended by `CANCEL`.

Exactly one of `LABEL`, `PROGRAM`, `CANCEL`, `RESET` must be given.

#### Conditions

| Condition | EIBRESP | Cause |
|---|---:|---|
| NORMAL | 0 | Exit registered or restored. |
| INVREQ | 16 | Conflicting / missing options, or `RESET` with no prior exit. |

#### Example

```rexx
ADDRESS CICS

EXEC CICS HANDLE ABEND LABEL(CLEANUP) END-EXEC

EXEC CICS WRITE FILE('LEDGER') RIDFLD(K) FROM(REC) END-EXEC
EXEC CICS WRITE FILE('AUDIT')  RIDFLD(K) FROM(REC) END-EXEC

/* something later may ABEND */
EXIT

CLEANUP:
   SAY 'Caught abend' EIBABCODE
   EXEC CICS SYNCPOINT ROLLBACK END-EXEC      /* undo both writes */
   EXEC CICS RETURN END-EXEC
```

## Chapter 11. The Execute Interface Block (EIB)

The EIB is a per-task scratch area populated by the dispatcher
before the program runs and by each `EXEC CICS` command on return.
In bricks the EIB is exposed as a set of well-known variable names
in the program's frame; both REXX and COBOL auto-inject the names
that aren't already declared.

| Field | Set by | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `EIBAID` | `SEND MAP` / `RECEIVE MAP` | Single-byte AID character of the most recent map response. Use `C2X(EIBAID)` (REXX) or compare with `X'F3'` (COBOL) to detect PF/PA/CLEAR/ENTER. |
| `EIBCPOSN` | `SEND MAP` / `RECEIVE MAP` | 1-based cursor position of the most recent map response. |
| `EIBCALEN` | dispatcher (per-task entry) | Length of `DFHCOMMAREA` flowed in from the prior task or `LINK` caller. Zero when no COMMAREA was passed. |
| `EIBTRMID` | dispatcher | This terminal's id. Same as `ASSIGN TERMID(...)`. |
| `EIBRESP` | every `EXEC CICS` | The response code of the most recent command (see [Chapter 12](#chapter-12-response-codes)). |
| `EIBRESP2` | every `EXEC CICS` | The secondary response code of the most recent command (currently always 0). |
| `RC` | every `EXEC CICS` | Mirror of `EIBRESP`, for REXX `IF RC <> 0` style. |
| `DFHCOMMAREA` | dispatcher / `LINK` / `RETURN` | The COMMAREA bytes; in COBOL, auto-injected as `PIC X(2000)` if not declared. |

### REXX

`EIBAID` and friends are ordinary REXX variables that the handlers
write through the `cics.Frame` interface. A REXX program tests them
exactly like any other variable:

```rexx
IF EIBRESP <> 0 THEN SAY 'Command failed, RC=' EIBRESP
IF C2X(EIBAID) = 'F3' THEN EXEC CICS RETURN END-EXEC
```

`SIGNAL ON ERROR` ([Chapter 18](#chapter-18-conditions-and-signal-on))
is the alternative to per-call `IF EIBRESP <>`.

### COBOL

The same names are auto-injected as `PIC` items if the program
doesn't declare them (`cobol.ensureSystemItems`). Test them with
ordinary `IF` clauses:

```cobol
IF EIBRESP NOT = 0
   DISPLAY 'Command failed'
END-IF.

IF EIBAID = X'F3'
   EXEC CICS RETURN END-EXEC
END-IF.
```

There is no COBOL equivalent of `SIGNAL ON ERROR` yet.

---

## Chapter 12. Response codes

After every `EXEC CICS` command the handler writes `EIBRESP`,
`EIBRESP2`, and `RC` into the program's frame. The full set of
constants is in `cics/resp.go`; the values a typical bricks program
tests for are:

| Constant | Value | Meaning |
|---|---:|---|
| `NORMAL` | 0 | Success. |
| `ERROR` | 1 | Generic error. |
| `EOC` | 6 | End-of-chain (second `RECEIVE` in same task). |
| `NOTFND` | 13 | Record / key not found. |
| `DUPREC` | 14 | `WRITE` collided with an existing key. |
| `DUPKEY` | 15 | Duplicate key on a non-unique index (reserved). |
| `INVREQ` | 16 | Invalid request: bad option combination, missing data store, invalid name. |
| `IOERR` | 17 | Underlying store / network IO failed. |
| `NOSPACE` | 18 | Out of storage (reserved). |
| `NOTOPEN` | 19 | File not open (reserved). |
| `ENDFILE` | 20 | Browse walked past the last key (or out of `GENERIC` prefix). |
| `LENGERR` | 22 | Length mismatch. |
| `QZERO` | 23 | Queue is empty (reserved). |
| `ITEMERR` | 26 | TS item out of range; typical at end-of-queue. |
| `PGMIDERR` | 27 | `LINK` / `XCTL` target not in `transactions.conf`, or sub-program errored, or caller is not authorised for the target. |
| `MAPFAIL` | 36 | `SEND MAP` / `RECEIVE MAP` could not find or render the named map. |
| `QIDERR` | 44 | TS queue id invalid or unknown. |

### Idiomatic error handling

**REXX, per-call test:**

```rexx
EXEC CICS READ FILE('CUSTOMERS') INTO(REC) RIDFLD(K) END-EXEC
SELECT
   WHEN EIBRESP = 0  THEN NOP
   WHEN EIBRESP = 13 THEN MSG = 'Customer' K 'not found'
   OTHERWISE              MSG = 'I/O error, RC=' EIBRESP
END
```

**REXX, signal-on:**

```rexx
SIGNAL ON ERROR NAME CICSERR
EXEC CICS READ FILE('CUSTOMERS') INTO(REC) RIDFLD(K) END-EXEC
...
EXIT
CICSERR:
   SAY 'CICS error at line' SIGL ', RC=' RC
   EXIT
```

**COBOL:**

```cobol
EXEC CICS READ FILE('CUSTOMERS') INTO(REC) RIDFLD(CKEY) END-EXEC
EVALUATE EIBRESP
   WHEN 0   CONTINUE
   WHEN 13  MOVE 'Customer not found' TO MSG
   WHEN OTHER MOVE 'I/O error' TO MSG
END-EVALUATE.
```

## Chapter 13. Commands not implemented

The following commands are not implemented and the parser does not
recognize them at all:

| Command | Use |
|---|---|
| `GETMAIN`, `FREEMAIN` | Dynamic storage. REXX has dynamic variables; COBOL has `WORKING-STORAGE`. |
| `LOAD`, `RELEASE` | Explicit program-fetch lifecycle. Bricks caches program text on first dispatch. |
| `WAIT EVENT`, `POST` | ECB-driven inter-task signalling — bricks's scheduler model does not expose ECBs. |

> **Recently added in 2.7.x.** `QUERY SECURITY` and `VERIFY PASSWORD`
> both graduated from this deferred list — programs can now ask the
> four-axis authorisation question and re-authenticate a userid /
> password pair through the verbs described in
> [Chapter 6 — Security inquiry](#chapter-6-system-services).

### DELAY

```
EXEC CICS DELAY
            {INTERVAL(hhmmss) | TIME(hhmmss) |
             FOR HOURS(h) MINUTES(m) SECONDS(s) MILLISECS(ms) |
             UNTIL HOURS(h) MINUTES(m) SECONDS(s)}
            [RESP(rc) RESP2(rc2)]
END-EXEC.
```

Suspends the issuing task until the given duration elapses (`INTERVAL`
/ `FOR`) or until the named time-of-day arrives (`TIME` / `UNTIL`). A
bare `DELAY` with no clauses is a `NORMAL` yield. `INTERVAL` and
`TIME` accept the same `HHMMSS` digit forms as `START`. `FOR` /
`UNTIL` are the IBM-canonical compositional alternatives — supply
any subset of `HOURS`, `MINUTES`, `SECONDS`, `MILLISECS`; the
millisecond clause is the only sub-second form available.

Bricks sleeps the calling goroutine; PA1 break-out continues to work
because the connection's prompt loop is unaffected. A long `DELAY` on
a terminal that disconnects mid-sleep ends when the conn read deadline
poisons the next dispatch — the task is not held alive past the
connection.

### CANCEL

```
EXEC CICS CANCEL
            {REQID(handle) | TRANSID(name) [TERMID(t)]}
            [RESP(rc) RESP2(rc2)]
END-EXEC.
```

Drops a pending `START` from the in-region scheduler. `REQID(handle)`
matches against the 1–8-character handle the originating `START`
supplied; bricks records the handle on the queued entry. `TRANSID(name)`
drops the soonest pending START to that transid on `TERMID` (default =
the issuing terminal). `RESP=NOTFND` (13) when no match.

The scheduler is in-memory; a bricks restart drops every pending
entry, after which any `CANCEL` returns `NOTFND`.

### ENQ / DEQ

```
EXEC CICS ENQ RESOURCE(name) [LENGTH(n)] [HOLD] [NOSUSPEND]
            [RESP(rc) RESP2(rc2)]
END-EXEC.

EXEC CICS DEQ RESOURCE(name) [LENGTH(n)]
            [RESP(rc) RESP2(rc2)]
END-EXEC.
```

Named-resource locking with region scope. `ENQ` blocks until the
resource is acquired; with `NOSUSPEND`, an already-held resource
returns `RESP=ENQBUSY` (55) immediately. A re-entrant `ENQ` by the
same task on the same resource is a `NORMAL` no-op. The default
lock scope is the next `SYNCPOINT` (commit or rollback) or task
end; `HOLD` extends the scope past `SYNCPOINT` so the lock persists
until an explicit `DEQ` or task end.

`LENGTH(n)` is accepted for source compatibility but bricks uses
the entire resolved `RESOURCE` value as the key (uppercased,
trimmed).

A non-`NOSUSPEND` `ENQ` that has waited five minutes for the holder
to release returns `ENQBUSY` rather than blocking indefinitely.
That cap converts a dropped-owner edge case into a clean recoverable
status; legitimate same-region holders are never close to that
limit.

#### Operator visibility — `CEMT INQUIRE ENQ`

`CEMT INQUIRE ENQ` (letter `E` on the INQUIRE menu) pages every
enqueue currently held and every task suspended behind one. It
answers the question a hung terminal raises: who holds the lock,
and for how long.

| Column | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `RESOURCE` | The uppercased, trimmed `RESOURCE` key. Names longer than 24 characters are truncated with a trailing `+`; the head is kept so the value still matches the `ENQ RESOURCE(...)` literal in your source. |
| `OWNER` | The owning task — the task number, else `TERM:<termid>` for a lock taken outside a task, else `ANON`. |
| `TRANID` / `TERM` | Joined from the live task table. A lock that outlives its task shows `-` rather than a stale name. |
| `STATE` | `OWNED` or `WAITING`. One `OWNED` row heads each resource, followed by its waiters, longest-waiting first. |
| `HOLD` | `YES` when the lock was taken with `HOLD` and so survives `SYNCPOINT` — usually the answer to "why is this lock still here?". `-` on a waiting row. |
| `AGE` | How long this task has held the lock, or has been waiting for it. A re-entrant `ENQ` does not reset it. |

The panel is read-only and open to every operator, not just
`ADMIN` — an enqueue is a resource, not internal control-block
detail, and every column is already visible elsewhere via
`INQUIRE TRANSACTION` and `INQUIRE TERMINAL`. `ENTER` re-snapshots,
`PF7` / `PF8` page, `PF3` exits.

On an idle region the panel shows `No enqueues held.` — and that
screen is live too: `ENTER` re-snapshots it, so an operator can sit
on it and watch for a lock to appear, at which point the table takes
over. `PF3` / `CLEAR` backs out.

IBM's `ENQTYPE` and `ENQSCOPE` columns are deliberately omitted
rather than filled with a constant: bricks has only `EXECENQ`
enqueues, and its locks are process-scoped, so a blank `ENQSCOPE`
(which means region scope in real CICS) would assert something
bricks cannot guarantee. `RETAINED` likewise never appears as a
`STATE`, because there are no shunted units of work to retain a
lock.

Because the snapshot is retaken on every `ENTER`, a refresh landing
between a holder's `DEQ` and the woken waiter's acquisition can
show a lone `WAITING` row with no `OWNED` row above it. That window
is real and brief, not a rendering fault.

### WRITE OPERATOR

```
EXEC CICS WRITE OPERATOR
            TEXT(area) [LENGTH(n)]
            [ROUTECODES(codes)] [NUMROUTES(n)]
            [EVENTUAL | ACTION | CRITICAL | IMMEDIATE]
            [CONSNAME(name)]
            [RESP(rc) RESP2(rc2)]
END-EXEC.
```

Writes `TEXT(area)` to the bricks console with the `SYS` tag. The
issuing `TERMID` is included so the operator can correlate the
message with the task that wrote it. `LENGTH(n)` bounds the bytes
written. `ROUTECODES`, `NUMROUTES`, `CONSNAME`, `EVENTUAL`,
`ACTION`, `CRITICAL`, and `IMMEDIATE` are accepted for source
compatibility but fold into a single console write — bricks has no
multi-console fan-out.

The `REPLY` form (`REPLY(var) MAXLENGTH(n) REPLYLENGTH(var)
[TIMEOUT(n)]`) is rejected with `RESP=INVREQ`. Bricks has no
operator-console input port to source the reply from, so accepting
it silently would hang the task. A program that needs operator
acknowledgement must reach the operator through `SEND MAP` on a
configured operator terminal.

### SEND CONTROL

```
EXEC CICS SEND CONTROL [ERASE | ERASEAUP]
            [FREEKB] [ALARM] [FRSET]
            [CURSOR(pos)] [PRINT] [LDC(name)] [STRFIELD]
            [RESP(rc) RESP2(rc2)]
END-EXEC.
```

3270 control order without a data payload — used between a
`SEND MAP DATAONLY` pre-paint and the next operator interaction to
clear the screen, unlock the keyboard, or reset MDTs without
re-painting any field content. `ERASE` and `ERASEAUP` clear the
screen; the other flags are accepted but their wire-bits are not
tunnelled by the underlying go3270 layer (`FREEKB` and `FRSET` are
part of every paint's fixed WCC, so they have no separate effect;
`ALARM` / `CURSOR` / `PRINT` / `STRFIELD` / `LDC` are silently
accepted so program source compiles). A flag-less `SEND CONTROL`
is a `NORMAL` no-op.

### Recently added

* **`CONVERSE`** — see [Chapter 4](#chapter-4-terminal-io-commands).
  Syntactic sugar for `SEND MAP` + `RECEIVE MAP`.
* **`START` / `RETRIEVE`** — see Chapter 5. Same-terminal
  scheduling with payload pass-through. Cross-terminal and
  no-`TERMID` (headless) STARTs are still deferred; the v1
  surface rejects them with `RESP-INVREQ` and a clear message.
* **`DELAY`, `CANCEL`, `ENQ` / `DEQ`, `WRITE OPERATOR`,
  `SEND CONTROL`** — round-4 verbs documented above.
* **`WEB *`** (server-side, Phase 1) — see "EXEC CICS WEB" below.
  The client-side surface (`WEB OPEN / SEND / RECEIVE / CONVERSE
  / CLOSE`) and the DOCUMENT API land in Phase 2; URIMAP / TLS
  / mTLS in Phase 3.

# Part 7. EXEC CICS WEB command reference

> **Part&nbsp;7 begins here.** Bricks ships a complete `EXEC CICS WEB`
> family — both the **inbound** (server-side, the WAPI listener) and
> the **outbound** (client-side, programs calling external HTTP
> services). The `DOCUMENT` API for assembling response bodies from
> many fragments is documented here too, alongside the URIMAP
> catalogue, inbound mTLS, the `CONVERSE WEB` alias, and the
> dedicated copybooks.

## EXEC CICS WEB — server side (Phase 1)

bricks ships an inbound HTTP listener that turns each matched
request into a transaction dispatch via the `EXEC CICS WEB *`
verbs. Enable it in `bricks.cnf` with `enable_wapi=yes`. Define
routes in `runtime/web_routes.conf` — the URIMAP layer; the
matched TRANSID is looked up in `transactions.conf` exactly as a
3270 operator's typed dispatch would. Both files reload on
mtime change, so adding a new route requires no restart.

```
# method  path-pattern         transid  [groups]   [response_timeout]
GET       /api/customer/{id}   WAPI     public
POST      /api/customer        WAPC     admin
GET       /api/orders/{id}     OAPI     users
DELETE    /admin/cache/{key}   CACR     admin                 5s
```

The matching `transactions.conf` rows route TRANSID → program
(REXX or COBOL) — same format used by 3270 dispatch:

```
WAPI:rexx:wapi.rexx:public,users,admin
WAPC:cobol:wapic.cob:admin
OAPI:rexx:orders.rexx:users,admin
CACR:cobol:cacheclr.cob:admin
```

A single program is therefore reachable from **both** the
3270 prompt (the operator types its TRANSID) and the HTTP
endpoint (a client hits the matching URL). The transaction
distinguishes the front door by which family of verbs it
calls — `EXEC CICS WEB *` returns INVREQ on a 3270 task, and
`EXEC CICS SEND MAP` is meaningless on a web task — but most
programs naturally use one set or the other.

A `{name}` placeholder in the path is exposed to the
transaction via `WEB READ QUERYPARM('name')`, sharing one
namespace with the inbound `?name=…` query string (path
captures win on conflict).

**A path capture is percent-decoded before the program sees it.**
The request path is matched in its *escaped* form, so a
percent-encoded `/` can never split a segment and fool a
single-segment placeholder — but the captured value is then
decoded, because it shares a namespace with the already-decoded
query string. `GET /api/customer/Smith%20John` against
`/api/customer/{id}` therefore gives `WEB READ QUERYPARM('id')`
the value `Smith John`, the same text `?id=Smith%20John` would
have produced. (Before this, the capture arrived raw, so one
program could see `id="Smith%20John"` next to `q="Smith John"`
for the very same name and the record lookup found nothing.)
A capture whose escape sequence is malformed makes the route not
match, and the request 404s.

### Authentication — the same `users.conf` that CSSN uses

A web client identifies itself using **HTTP Basic
authentication**, and bricks verifies the credentials against the
exact same `users.conf` and bcrypt hash that the `CSSN` sign-on
transaction uses on the 3270. The credential carrier is different
(an HTTP header instead of a 3270 password field); everything
downstream is identical.

| Layer | 3270 / `CSSN` | WAPI / HTTP |
|---|---|---|
| Credential store | `runtime/users.conf` | `runtime/users.conf` (same file) |
| Hashing | bcrypt | bcrypt |
| Verification call | `auth.FileStore.Authenticate(user, pass)` | `auth.FileStore.Authenticate(user, pass)` (same call) |
| Credential carrier | Hidden `PASSWORD` field on the CSSN map, posted by SEND→RECEIVE | `Authorization: Basic base64(user:pass)` header |
| Operator-visible state | `sess.Authenticated=true`; `UCB` attached for the whole 3270 session until `CSSF LOGOFF` | One-shot per request — `sess.Authenticated=true` for the dispatch only |
| What the transaction sees | `EXEC CICS ASSIGN USERID(...)` returns the operator | Same — `EXEC CICS ASSIGN USERID(...)` returns the bcrypt-verified user |

The dispatch flow per request:

1. **No `Authorization` header** — if the route's `groups` column
   contains the literal token `public`, the request is accepted
   as anonymous (`UserID=""`, `Authenticated=false`); otherwise
   the response is **401 Unauthorized** with
   `WWW-Authenticate: Basic realm="bricks"` so a browser shows
   the standard credential prompt.
2. **`Authorization: Basic base64(user:pass)`** — the credential
   is base64-decoded, split on `:`, then `auth.FileStore.Authenticate`
   runs (same path CSSN uses), comparing the password
   **exactly** — byte for byte, case included. On success the
   user's `users.conf` groups are matched against the route's
   groups: **any one** shared group admits the caller.
3. **Authenticated AND a group matches** — dispatch proceeds with
   `sess.Authenticated=true`, `sess.UserID=<username>`,
   `sess.Groups=<users.conf groups>`. The dispatcher's
   `IsAllowed` gate runs again against the TRANSID's
   `transactions.conf` groups, so **both** layers must permit the
   caller before the program runs.
4. **Authenticated but no group match** — **403 Forbidden**.
5. **Authentication fails** (wrong password, unknown user,
   malformed header) — **401 Unauthorized**.

ACL policy is **opt-in**: a `web_routes.conf` row with no
`groups` column denies every request, log warning at boot. Add
the literal `public` to permit anonymous access; add specific
group names (`users`, `admin`, etc.) to require Basic-Auth
against `users.conf` for a user belonging to that group.

Two properties of that column are easy to get wrong:

* **The list is a UNION, not an intersection.** `admin,users`
  admits anyone in *either* group, and `public` anywhere in the
  list makes the whole route unauthenticated — `admin,public` is
  exactly as open as `public` alone. There is **no way to spell
  "public AND admin"**; if the route is meant to be restricted,
  leave `public` out. bricks warns at load when a row mixes them.
* **A row has at most 5 fields, and a 6th is a hard error.** It
  used to be silently discarded, so
  `GET /admin ADMN public 5s admin` loaded as `Groups=[PUBLIC]`
  and served the admin route to unauthenticated callers with a
  `200`. Such a row is now refused (and the route 404s, which is
  the safe direction to fail in). Every group goes in **one**
  comma-separated field with no spaces.

A user `alice` listed in `users.conf` as
`alice:<bcrypt-hash>:users,admin` can run the **same** TRANSID
from both front doors with the same credential:

```bash
curl -u alice:alice-password http://localhost:8080/api/orders/42
# → 200 + JSON body, sess.UserID=alice

curl -u alice:wrong-password http://localhost:8080/api/orders/42
# → 401 Unauthorized

curl http://localhost:8080/api/orders/42
# → 401 Unauthorized (no Authorization header)
```

…and at a 3270 emulator she signs on with `CSSN` →
`alice` / `alice-password` and types the same TRANSID. The
program sees the same `EIBTRMID / USERID / EIBCALEN` set and
serves both callers identically. Most programs don't even need
to know which front door they came from.

**What's intentionally NOT yet supported:**

- **Bearer tokens / cookies / sessions** — every request is
  stateless and re-authenticates against `users.conf`. There is
  no equivalent of the 3270 "stay signed on until CSSF LOGOFF"
  state across HTTP requests. The token-mint endpoint and
  `Authorization: Bearer …` flow land in Phase 3.
- **OAuth / JWT / OIDC** — Phase 3+ work.
- **Per-request authentication via the `CSSN` transaction
  itself** — `CSSN` is a 3270-only screen artefact; pointing a
  route at it doesn't produce the browser UX a credential
  prompt should have. The Phase 3 token endpoint will be the
  right shape for that.

### Server-side verb set

The Phase 1 verb set:

| Verb | Use |
|---|---|
| `WEB EXTRACT METHOD(var) PATH(var) …` | Request metadata: METHOD / SCHEME / HOST / PORT / PATH / QUERYSTRING / HTTPVERSION / CLIENTADDR / SERVERADDR. Each option is the name of a target variable. |
| `WEB READ HTTPHEADER(name) VALUE(var) [LENGTH(var)]` | Read one inbound header. `NOTFND` when absent. |
| `WEB STARTBROWSE HTTPHEADER` / `WEB READNEXT HTTPHEADER NAME(var) VALUE(var) [NAMELENGTH(var)] [VALUELENGTH(var)]` / `WEB ENDBROWSE HTTPHEADER` | Walk every inbound header in sorted order. `ENDFILE` when exhausted. |
| `WEB READ QUERYPARM(name) VALUE(var)` | Read query parameter OR routing-table `{name}` capture. Both are **percent-decoded** — `%20` reaches the program as a space. `NOTFND` when absent. |
| `WEB STARTBROWSE QUERYPARM` / `WEB READNEXT QUERYPARM …` / `WEB ENDBROWSE QUERYPARM` | Iterate every parameter / capture. |
| `WEB READ FORMFIELD(name) VALUE(var)` | Read one `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` field. Body parsed lazily on first call. |
| `WEB STARTBROWSE FORMFIELD` / `WEB READNEXT FORMFIELD …` / `WEB ENDBROWSE FORMFIELD` | Iterate form fields. |
| `WEB RECEIVE INTO(var) [MAXLENGTH(n)] [LENGTH(var)] [TYPE(var)] [MEDIATYPE(var)]` | Read the raw request body. `LENGERR` when over MAXLENGTH. |
| `WEB WRITE HTTPHEADER(name) VALUE(value)` | Set / append an outbound response header. |
| `WEB SEND FROM(buf) [MEDIATYPE(s)] [STATUSCODE(n)]` | Emit response status + body. First `SEND` wins for status/MEDIATYPE; subsequent `SEND` calls in the same task append to the body (matches CICS). |
| `WEB PARSE URL URL(s) SCHEMENAME(var) HOST(var) PORT(var) PATH(var) QUERYSTRING(var) [HOSTLENGTH(var)] …` | Direction-agnostic URL splitter. |
| `WEB CONVERTTIME DATESTRING(s) ABSTIME(var)` | RFC 1123 / 850 / asctime → milliseconds since 1970-01-01 UTC. |

The full REXX sample is `runtime/rexx/wapi.rexx`; in COBOL the
helpful copybooks are `DFHWBSC` (status-code constants),
`DFHWBUH` (common header-name literals), `DFHWBMT` (MIME-type
literals), and `DFHWBMETH` (HTTP method literals).

## EXEC CICS WEB — client side (Phase 2a)

The same `WEB` verb family also drives **outbound** HTTP — a
bricks transaction calling a remote HTTP service. No
`bricks.cnf` toggle is required; bricks builds one shared
`*http.Client` at startup (tuned by `web_client_timeout` /
`web_client_max_idle_conns` / `web_client_tls_skip_verify`) and
every task reuses it. The host's CA bundle validates outbound
HTTPS certificates by default — point at any normal public
HTTPS endpoint and it just works.

The client uses a per-task **session token**: `WEB OPEN`
returns a 32-character hex token; subsequent `WEB SEND` /
`WEB RECEIVE` / `WEB CONVERSE` / `WEB CLOSE` all thread that
token via `SESSTOKEN(...)`. A token still open at task end is
auto-closed (dispatcher defer, mirrors `CloseBrowses` /
`CloseAllTD`).

The Phase 2a verb set:

| Verb | Use |
|---|---|
| `WEB OPEN HOST(s) [PORT(n)] [SCHEME(s)] SESSTOKEN(var)` | Open a logical client session. PORT defaults to 80 (HTTP) / 443 (HTTPS). SCHEME defaults to `http`. The token is written into the variable named by SESSTOKEN. |
| `WEB CONVERSE SESSTOKEN(t) METHOD(s) PATH(s) [FROM(buf)] [LENGTH(n)] [QUERYSTRING(s)] [MEDIATYPE(s)] INTO(var) [STATUSCODE(var)] [STATUSTEXT(var)] [MEDIATYPE(var)] [TYPE(var)] [MAXLENGTH(n)] [LENGTH(var)]` | One-shot send + receive. Builds the request, fires it through the shared client, writes the response body into INTO; LENGERR when the body exceeds MAXLENGTH (default 1 MiB). |
| `WEB SEND SESSTOKEN(t) METHOD(s) PATH(s) [FROM(buf)] [QUERYSTRING(s)] [MEDIATYPE(s)]` | Stage a request on the session (no round-trip yet). |
| `WEB RECEIVE SESSTOKEN(t) INTO(var) [STATUSCODE(var)] [STATUSTEXT(var)] [MEDIATYPE(var)] [MAXLENGTH(n)]` | Fire the staged request; populate the named output variables from the response. |
| `WEB CLOSE SESSTOKEN(t)` | Release the session and the underlying response body. |
| `WEB WRITE HTTPHEADER(name) VALUE(v) SESSTOKEN(t)` | Set an outbound *request* header on the session. Repeated WRITE calls for the same name produce multi-valued headers (matches `http.Header.Add`). Must precede the next SEND / CONVERSE -- headers committed at request build time. |
| `WEB READ HTTPHEADER(name) VALUE(var) [LENGTH(var)] SESSTOKEN(t)` | Read one response header by name from the most-recent SEND/CONVERSE/RECEIVE on the session. Case-insensitive name match. `NOTFND` when absent; `INVREQ` when no response has landed yet. |
| `WEB STARTBROWSE HTTPHEADER SESSTOKEN(t)` / `WEB READNEXT HTTPHEADER NAME(var) VALUE(var) [NAMELENGTH(var)] [VALUELENGTH(var)] SESSTOKEN(t)` / `WEB ENDBROWSE HTTPHEADER SESSTOKEN(t)` | Iterate every response header in sorted order. `ENDFILE` when exhausted; `INVREQ` when no STARTBROWSE has run on the session. |
| `WEB EXTRACT SESSTOKEN(t) [SCHEME(var)] [HOST(var)] [PORT(var)] [PATH(var)] [HOSTLENGTH(var)] [PORTNUMBER(var)]` | Inspect the session's resolved endpoint *after* OPEN. Distinct from `WEB EXTRACT URIMAP(name)` (no token) and from the server-side request-meta form (no token, different option set). |

Bricks issues `Accept: */*` and `User-Agent: bricks-cics/1.0`
on every outbound request by default; both can be overridden
with `WEB WRITE HTTPHEADER('User-Agent') VALUE(...) SESSTOKEN(t)`
before the next SEND / CONVERSE on that session. The
`runtime/cobol/whdr.cob` sample (TRANSID `WHDR`) walks through
the WRITE-then-READ flow end-to-end.

RESP codes: `NORMAL`, `NOTFND` (unknown SESSTOKEN), `INVREQ`
(missing required option, web client not configured), `IOERR`
(network / TLS / timeout), `LENGERR` (body over MAXLENGTH).

### COBOL copybook for the client surface

`runtime/cobolcopy/DFHWBSI.cpy` carries the standard
session-token + body buffer templates:

```cobol
       01 DFH-WB-SESS     PIC X(36).
       01 DFH-WB-BODY     PIC X(8192).
       01 DFH-WB-URL      PIC X(2048).
```

Pair it with the existing `DFHWBSC` (status codes) and
`DFHWBMETH` (HTTP method literals) so a CICS-style program
reads idiomatically:

```cobol
       COPY DFHRESP.
       COPY DFHWBSC.
       COPY DFHWBMETH.
       COPY DFHWBSI.

       EXEC CICS WEB OPEN HOST('api.github.com') PORT(443)
                          SCHEME('HTTPS')
                          SESSTOKEN(DFH-WB-SESS) END-EXEC.

       EXEC CICS WEB CONVERSE SESSTOKEN(DFH-WB-SESS)
                              METHOD(WB-GET)
                              PATH('/zen')
                              INTO(DFH-WB-BODY)
                              STATUSCODE(STAT) END-EXEC.

       EXEC CICS WEB CLOSE SESSTOKEN(DFH-WB-SESS) END-EXEC.

       IF STAT = DFHRESP-WB-OK ...
```

### URIMAP — symbolic outbound endpoints (Phase 3a)

A URIMAP entry in `runtime/web_routes.conf` defines a named
upstream service that outbound transactions reference by symbol.
Both layers of `web_routes.conf` (routes for inbound, URIMAPs
for outbound) live in the same file and hot-reload together.

```
# Format: URIMAP NAME scheme://host[:port][/path-prefix]
URIMAP   GITHUB    https://api.github.com
URIMAP   WEATHER   https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5
URIMAP   INTRANET  https://api.internal:8443/v1
```

Names are 1..8 uppercase characters (CICS resource-name limit),
drawn from `A-Z`, `0-9` and the national characters `$ @ #` plus
`_`. The charset is enforced at parse and at the `CEDA URIMAP`
write path, so a name such as `A;B` — which used to load and then
never match what a program asked for — is refused with
`URIMAP name: only A-Z 0-9 $ @ # allowed`.
The path-prefix is optional; when set, it becomes the leading
segment of every PATH the program later supplies on `WEB SEND`
/ `WEB CONVERSE`. So `URIMAP WEATHER ...data/2.5` paired with
`WEB CONVERSE PATH('/weather?city=NYC')` issues against
`https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?city=NYC`.

The URIMAP-aware verb shapes:

| Verb | Use |
|---|---|
| `WEB OPEN URIMAP(name) SESSTOKEN(var)` | Open a client session against the named endpoint. SCHEME / HOST / PORT come from the URIMAP row; explicit `HOST(...)` / `PORT(...)` / `SCHEME(...)` on the same command override per-field (matches IBM CICS). `NOTFND` when the name is unknown. |
| `WEB SEND URIMAP(name) METHOD(s) PATH(s) [FROM(buf)] [QUERYSTRING(s)] [MEDIATYPE(s)] INTO(var) [STATUSCODE(var)] [STATUSTEXT(var)] [LENGTH(var)] [MAXLENGTH(n)]` | One-shot OPEN + CONVERSE + CLOSE: no `SESSTOKEN` required. Resolves the URIMAP, opens a fresh session, sends the request, populates INTO and the named output variables from the response, and releases the session. Use for fire-and-forget outbound calls where session-token plumbing has no value. (Phase 3b.) |
| `WEB EXTRACT URIMAP(name) [SCHEME(var)] [HOST(var)] [PORT(var)] [PATH(var)] [HOSTLENGTH(var)] [PORTNUMBER(var)]` | Inspect a URIMAP definition without opening a session. Used by programs that branch on the resolved endpoint or need to display it to an operator. `NOTFND` when the name is unknown. |

URIMAP rows load even when `enable_wapi=no` — outbound-only
deployments are supported without exposing any inbound listener.

The `runtime/cobolcopy/DFHWBUM.cpy` copybook ships the
conventional WORKING-STORAGE variables:

```cobol
       01 DFH-WB-UM-NAME    PIC X(8).
       01 DFH-WB-UM-SCHEME  PIC X(8).
       01 DFH-WB-UM-HOST    PIC X(64).
       01 DFH-WB-UM-PORT    PIC X(5).
       01 DFH-WB-UM-PATH    PIC X(128).
```

### Outbound TLS verification (Phase 3a)

By default the outbound HTTPS client verifies upstream
certificates against the host system's trust store — the OS's
`/etc/ssl/certs/...` bundle on Linux, the Keychain on macOS,
Windows trust store on Windows. Three `bricks.cnf` knobs adjust:

| Knob | Use |
|---|---|
| `web_client_ca_bundle` | Path to a PEM file of trusted CAs. When set, bricks uses ONLY these for verification — the system trust store is ignored. Useful for internal CAs that aren't installed system-wide. |
| `web_client_cert` + `web_client_key` | PEM client-cert and key for outbound mTLS. Presented to upstream services that require the caller to authenticate with a certificate. Both must be set together; one without the other is a startup error. |
| `web_client_tls_skip_verify` | `yes` accepts ANY upstream certificate — test-only escape hatch for self-signed endpoints. Logs a loud startup `WARNING`; never use in production. |

### Operator visibility (Phase 3a)

- **`CEMT INQUIRE URIMAP`** — pages the URIMAP rows loaded
  from `web_routes.conf` (NAME / SCHEME / HOST / PORT /
  PATH-PREFIX).
- **`CEMT INQUIRE WEB`** — pages the inbound HTTP requests
  currently in dispatch (METHOD / URI / TERM / TRANSID / USER /
  AGE). When no requests are in flight, the screen still shows
  a one-row summary with the lifetime request / error totals.

### Phase 2a sample — `wzen.cob`

`runtime/cobol/wzen.cob` (TRANSID `WZEN`) is the shipped
end-to-end demonstration. It fetches GitHub's `/zen` endpoint
over HTTPS — a single-line plain-text response, no JSON parsing
needed — and renders the result on the `WZEN1` 3270 map. The
program demonstrates the full client lifecycle, branches
cleanly on each `EIBRESP`, and surfaces network / HTTP failures
with a distinct error path so the operator sees what went wrong
on the 3270 screen rather than getting an opaque abend.

Drive it from a 3270 emulator: sign on (`CSSN` → `admin`),
type `WZEN`, press ENTER. The first line under the header
shows the actual URL fetched (`GET https://api.github.com/zen`)
so the demo is self-documenting; the body appears on row 8.

### Phase 2b sample — `whdr.cob` (custom request + response headers)

`runtime/cobol/whdr.cob` (TRANSID `WHDR`) is the canonical
end-to-end demonstration of `WEB WRITE HTTPHEADER` and
`WEB READ HTTPHEADER` on a client session. It opens the
`GITHUB` URIMAP, sets two outbound headers
(`User-Agent: bricks-whdr/1.0`, `Accept: text/plain`), issues
`GET /zen`, then reads three response headers — two that
always land on a GitHub response (`Content-Type`, `Server`)
and one deliberately-absent header to exercise the `NOTFND`
branch. The 3270 screen shows the request headers sent, the
response headers received, and the body excerpt.

Drive it the same way as `WZEN`: sign on with `CSSN`, type
`WHDR`, press ENTER. Pair the screen with `CEMT INQUIRE WEB`
in a second 3270 session to watch the per-route counters move
each time you rerun the transaction.

## EXEC CICS DOCUMENT — chunked body builder

The `DOCUMENT` API is the buffer-builder that pairs with
`WEB SEND DOCTOKEN(t)` for programs assembling large responses
from many small fragments. Classic CICS pattern for emitting
HTML / XML / JSON in pieces; the bricks implementation also
serves as the chunk store for `WEB RETRIEVE DOCTOKEN(var)`
when programs want the inbound body as a document handle
instead of a flat `INTO(buf)`.

| Verb | Use |
|---|---|
| `DOCUMENT CREATE DOCTOKEN(var) [SYMBOLLIST(s)] [LISTLENGTH(n)] [DELIMITER(s)]` | Allocate a fresh empty document; return its token in the named variable. Optional `SYMBOLLIST` seeds a `name=value&...` symbol table that subsequent INSERT SYMBOL(...) substitutes from. |
| `DOCUMENT INSERT DOCTOKEN(t) [FROM(buf) [LENGTH(n)] \| TEXT(buf) \| BINARY(buf) \| SYMBOL(name) \| DOCUMENT(other-token)] [AT(position)]` | Append (or splice with `AT(position)`) one chunk to the document. `SYMBOL(name)` substitutes from the bound symbol list (`NOTFND` when unknown); `DOCUMENT(other-token)` splices another document verbatim (`NOTFND` when unknown); `TEXT` and `BINARY` are codepage-aware in real CICS but collapse to `FROM` in bricks (single-codepage). `LENGERR` when the resulting buffer would exceed 4 MiB. |
| `DOCUMENT SET DOCTOKEN(t) SYMBOLLIST(s) [LISTLENGTH(n)] [DELIMITER(d)] [UNESCAPED]` | (Re-)bind the symbol list a subsequent INSERT SYMBOL substitutes from. Pass an empty `SYMBOLLIST` to clear. |
| `DOCUMENT RETRIEVE DOCTOKEN(t) INTO(buf) LENGTH(var) [CHARACTERSET(s)] [DATAONLY \| HOSTCODEPAGE]` | Read the assembled body back into `INTO`; `LENGTH` receives the byte count. `CHARACTERSET / DATAONLY / HOSTCODEPAGE` are accepted but ignored (bricks is single-codepage ASCII). |
| `DOCUMENT DELETE DOCTOKEN(t)` | Release the document. `NOTFND` when the token isn't known. Forgotten documents are released at task end automatically. |
| `WEB SEND DOCTOKEN(t) [STATUSCODE(n)] [MEDIATYPE(s)]` | Emit the named document as the outbound response body. The DOCUMENT INSERT chain has already built it; SEND just splices the bytes onto BodyOut. `NOTFND` when the token isn't known. |
| `WEB RETRIEVE DOCTOKEN(var)` | Inbound-body-as-document. Allocates a fresh document, copies the request body into it, and returns the token. Alternative to `WEB RECEIVE INTO(buf)` for programs that prefer the document API. |

The standard COBOL declaration:

```cobol
       COPY DFHDCDOC.   *> DFH-DOC-TOK (PIC X(36)) + delimiter constants

       EXEC CICS DOCUMENT CREATE DOCTOKEN(DFH-DOC-TOK) END-EXEC.
       EXEC CICS DOCUMENT INSERT DOCTOKEN(DFH-DOC-TOK)
                                 FROM('<html><body>') END-EXEC.
       EXEC CICS DOCUMENT INSERT DOCTOKEN(DFH-DOC-TOK)
                                 FROM(BODY-CHUNK) END-EXEC.
       EXEC CICS DOCUMENT INSERT DOCTOKEN(DFH-DOC-TOK)
                                 FROM('</body></html>') END-EXEC.
       EXEC CICS WEB SEND DOCTOKEN(DFH-DOC-TOK)
                          MEDIATYPE('text/html')
                          STATUSCODE(200) END-EXEC.
```

RESP codes: `NORMAL`, `NOTFND` (unknown DOCTOKEN, unknown
SYMBOL, unknown spliced DOCUMENT), `INVREQ` (missing required
option), `LENGERR` (INSERT would exceed 4 MiB), `IOERR` (token
generation failed).

## EXEC CICS WEB — Phase 3b additions

Phase 3b closes out the master Phase-3 surface. Each addition
slots onto the foundations laid by 3a (URIMAP catalogue, active-
request tracking, outbound TLS extras) without breaking existing
verb shapes.

### `CONVERSE WEB` — alias for `WEB CONVERSE`

Some shops write the keywords in either order; bricks normalises
both at the parser, so the two forms below dispatch identical:

```cobol
       EXEC CICS WEB CONVERSE SESSTOKEN(T) METHOD('GET')
                              PATH('/x') INTO(B) END-EXEC.
       EXEC CICS CONVERSE WEB SESSTOKEN(T) METHOD('GET')
                              PATH('/x') INTO(B) END-EXEC.
```

### `WEB EXTRACT TCPIPSERVICE` — inspect the receiving listener

When `WEB EXTRACT` carries the `TCPIPSERVICE` keyword (or the
legacy `EXTRACT TCPIP` form without `WEB`), the verb reports
the listener that received the inbound request:

| Output | Source |
|---|---|
| `TCPIPSERVICE(var)` | Symbolic listener name — `WAPI` for the plain port, `WAPITLS` for the TLS port. |
| `PORTNUMBER(var)` | Numeric port the listener is bound to. |
| `IPADDRESS(var)` | The server's bind address (mirrors `bricks.cnf::dns_name`). |
| `CLIENT(var)` | Caller's IP address (mirrors `WEB EXTRACT CLIENTADDR`). |
| `AUTHENTICATE(var)` | `BASIC` when the request carried `Authorization: Basic …`, blank otherwise. |

The legacy form drops the `WEB` keyword entirely — the parser
recognises `EXTRACT TCPIP CLIENT(…) AUTHENTICATE(…)` and routes
it through the same handler. Useful for programs ported from
pre-CICS-TS web-services code.

### Inbound mTLS + `WEB EXTRACT CERTIFICATE`

Set `web_inbound_client_ca=ca.pem` to require every TLS client
to present a certificate signed by `ca.pem`. The TLS handshake
rejects unauthorised clients before any verb runs — no transaction
is dispatched at all. Inside the dispatched program, `WEB EXTRACT
CERTIFICATE` reads the verified peer cert:

| Output | Source on the peer cert |
|---|---|
| `COMMONNAME(var)` | Subject CN. |
| `ORGANISATION(var)` | Subject O. |
| `COUNTRY(var)` | Subject C. |
| `SERIALNUM(var)` | Hex serial number. |
| `ISSUER(var)` | Issuer CN. |
| `ISSUERORG(var)` | Issuer O. |

`EIBRESP = NOTFND` on plain (non-TLS) requests and on TLS
requests that carried no client cert — so one TRANSID can serve
both authenticated and anonymous callers and branch on the resp.

```cobol
       COPY DFHRESP.
       COPY DFHWBCC.   *> CN / ORG / CO / SERIAL / ISSUER buffers
       EXEC CICS WEB EXTRACT CERTIFICATE
                       COMMONNAME(DFH-WB-CN)
                       ORGANISATION(DFH-WB-ORG)
                       COUNTRY(DFH-WB-CO)
                       SERIALNUM(DFH-WB-SERIAL)
                       ISSUER(DFH-WB-ISSUER)
       END-EXEC.
       EVALUATE EIBRESP
           WHEN DFHRESP(NORMAL)
              *> Verified cert -- use the fields.
           WHEN DFHRESP(NOTFND)
              *> Plain HTTP or TLS without a client cert.
       END-EVALUATE.
```

### HTTP/2 on the inbound TLS listener

Go's `net/http` server auto-negotiates HTTP/2 over the TLS
listener via ALPN whenever `tls.Config.NextProtos` is left
unset — which bricks does on the WAPI TLS port. No knob is
required; clients that advertise `h2` in their ALPN list get
HTTP/2, clients that don't fall back to HTTP/1.1. Verify with
`curl --http2 -v https://localhost:443/...` and look for
`ALPN, server accepted to use h2` in the trace output.
Cleartext HTTP/2 (`h2c`) is not enabled — the plain port stays
on HTTP/1.1 to avoid a transitive dependency on
`golang.org/x/net/http2/h2c`.

### `CEDA URIMAP` — live edit the URIMAP catalogue

The Phase 3a `CEMT INQUIRE URIMAP` browser becomes
operator-editable in 3b. Type `CEDA URIMAP` (or `CEDA M`) from
the 3270 prompt for the list view:

```
S  NAME       SCHEME    HOST                              PORT   PATH
_  GITHUB     https     api.github.com                    443    -
_  WEATHER    https     api.openweathermap.org            443    /data/2.5
_  INTRANET   https     api.internal                      8443   /v1
```

- Type `A` in the selector column for **Alter** — opens a form
  pre-loaded with the row's endpoint URL so a one-character edit
  is enough to repoint the URIMAP.
- Type `D` in the selector column for **Delete** — a Y/N
  confirmation overlay opens; the row is removed only when the
  operator types `Y`.
- Press **PF6** for **Define new** — opens an empty form for
  the NAME (1..8 chars) and ENDPOINT URL
  (`scheme://host[:port][/path-prefix]`).

Every committed change is written atomically through a temp +
rename to `web_routes.conf`, with an mtime guard that refuses
the write if the file was modified externally between when the
screen loaded and when the operator pressed PF5. Each successful
mutation logs an audit line in the bricks log:

```
ceda=URIMAP op=DEFINE user=ADMIN term=T0001 target=NEWAPI detail=https://internal.svc:8443/v2
```

so the audit trail of who changed which row when is greppable.

The new in-process surface that backs the screen lives on
`*web.Table`: `AddURIMap`, `AlterURIMap`, `DeleteURIMap`, and
`Mtime()` for the optimistic-concurrency guard. Programs in REXX
or COBOL **do not call these directly** — they're the CEDA
implementation, not part of the EXEC CICS surface.

---

# Part 3. The REXX language

> **Part&nbsp;3 begins here.** This part describes the REXX dialect
> bricks accepts and the small preprocessor that rewrites
> `EXEC CICS` blocks into the same parsed command shape COBOL
> produces. Every command in **Part&nbsp;4** (`EXEC CICS`),
> **Part&nbsp;6** (`EXEC SQL`) and **Part&nbsp;7** (`EXEC CICS WEB`)
> is available verbatim from REXX with identical semantics.

## Chapter 14. REXX program structure

A bricks REXX program is a flat sequence of statements with optional
labels and procedures. Execution begins at the first statement; the
program ends when execution falls off the bottom, or hits `EXIT`. A
program file is plain UTF-8 (ASCII printable + tabs + LF only is
recommended for terminal output). There is no fixed column
discipline — newlines and whitespace are token separators.

```rexx
/* HELO — minimum REXX program */
ADDRESS CICS
EXEC CICS SEND MAP('HELO1') ERASE END-EXEC
EXEC CICS RETURN END-EXEC
```

### Comments

Block comments `/* ... */` may span multiple lines; nesting is not
supported. A REXX program traditionally opens with a one-line
header comment so the operator gets a description in CEDA / CEMT
when applicable.

### Statements

Statements are separated by newlines or `;`. The parser does not
require a terminator after the last statement of a block. Labels
have the form `NAME:` and may appear at any statement position.

### String literals

A string is written in single or double quotes (`'…'` / `"…"`); a
doubled quote inside is an escaped quote (`'it''s'`). A quoted string
immediately followed by an `X` (hexadecimal) or `B` (binary) suffix —
with no intervening blank — is a **hex / binary literal** whose value is
the decoded bytes:

| Literal | Value (bytes) |
|---|---|
| `'F3'X` | one byte `0xF3` |
| `'F1F2'X` | `0xF1 0xF2` |
| `'1'X` | `0x01` (an odd hex-digit count is left-padded with `0`) |
| `'0110'B` | `0x06` (left-padded to a full byte, then bit-packed) |
| `''X` / `''B` | the empty string |

The suffix is recognised only when the `X` / `B` is a standalone letter:
`'03'XY` is the string `'03'` followed by the symbol `XY` (juxtaposition),
*not* a hex literal. Invalid digits (`'GG'X`, `'2'B`) raise a SYNTAX error.
Decoded literals are ordinary byte strings — `C2X('F3'X)` is `'F3'`, and
`X2C` / `D2C` / `B2X` round-trip them.

### Procedures

A label followed by `PROCEDURE [EXPOSE list]` defines a procedure
with its own variable scope. `EXPOSE` re-routes named variables to
the caller's frame recursively. Both simple names and stem roots
(trailing dot) are accepted in the EXPOSE list. A procedure is
dispatched by name from both the `CALL` statement and the
`NAME(args)` function form; a `PROCEDURE` whose name matches a
built-in shadows it (internal routines are resolved first, per
standard REXX).

```rexx
CALL GREET 'Alice'
EXIT

GREET: PROCEDURE EXPOSE LANG.
   PARSE ARG NAME
   SAY LANG.HELLO NAME
   RETURN
```

A procedure returns to its caller on `RETURN [expr]` or by falling
off the bottom. The optional `expr` is assigned to the caller's
special variable `RESULT`; a bare `RETURN` or a fall-off-end
drops `RESULT` so the caller's existing value is not silently
masked. Recursion is permitted (the only ceiling is the
interpreter's `MaxSteps` runaway guard).

A procedure may be invoked either as a `CALL` statement or as a
**function** in an expression — `Y = DOUBLE(21)`. In the function
form the routine MUST `RETURN` a value; a bare `RETURN` or a
fall-off-end raises a SYNTAX error ("function did not return data").
`RETURN ''` counts as data. (As a `CALL` statement, a value-less
return is fine and simply leaves `RESULT` unset.)

The `NUMERIC` settings, the `ADDRESS` environment, and the
`SIGNAL ON` / `CALL ON` condition traps are saved when a procedure is
entered and restored on `RETURN`, so a routine may change them locally
without leaking the change back to its caller.

```rexx
SAY DOUBLE(21)               /* 42 — internal routine called as a function */
EXIT

DOUBLE: PROCEDURE
   PARSE ARG N
   RETURN N * 2
```

### `ADDRESS`

`ADDRESS <env>` switches the active command handler. Bare strings
inside an `ADDRESS` scope are commands routed to that handler;
bricks ships a `CICS` handler. `ADDRESS` with no argument clears
the active environment, after which a bare string is a syntax
error.

```rexx
ADDRESS CICS
"SEND MAP('CUST1') FROM(SCR.) ERASE"
"RETURN"
```

A command's return code is assigned to the special variable `RC`.
A non-zero `RC` fires `SIGNAL ON ERROR` (if armed) — see
[Chapter 18](#chapter-18-conditions-and-signal-on).

### Special variables

| Name | Set by | Cleared by |
|---|---|---|
| `RC` | Every command (bare string) executed under an `ADDRESS` env, every `EXEC CICS` / `EXEC SQL`. | Survives until the next command updates it. |
| `RESULT` | `CALL fn …` when the called procedure does `RETURN expr`. | A bare `RETURN`, a fall-off-end, or `DROP RESULT`. |
| `SIGL` | Any direct `SIGNAL` and every condition trap (set to the source line of the failing statement). | Survives the trap; persists across normal flow. |
| `SQLCODE` / `SQLSTATE` / `SQLERRMC` | Every `EXEC SQL` verb. | Next `EXEC SQL`. |

These names are otherwise ordinary writable variables; nothing
stops a program from assigning them, though doing so is bad
hygiene.

### The `EXEC CICS` / `EXEC SQL` preprocessor

Bricks parses `EXEC CICS verb operand-list END-EXEC` (and the
`EXEC SQL` form) as a single command at the same statement
position a bare string would occupy under `ADDRESS CICS`. The two
forms compile to the same dispatch path, so

```rexx
EXEC CICS SEND MAP('HELO1') ERASE END-EXEC
```

and

```rexx
ADDRESS CICS
"SEND MAP('HELO1') ERASE"
```

are equivalent. The `EXEC` form is preferred in shipped programs
because it doesn't depend on the current `ADDRESS` environment
and survives an explicit `ADDRESS` switch.

---

## Chapter 15. Variables and stems

### Naming rules

* Names are case-insensitive; internally everything is uppercased
  before lookup.
* A name begins with a letter or `_` and may continue with
  letters, digits, `_`, or `!`, `?`, `#`, `@`, `$`. Stem-tail
  segments are separated by `.`.
* The literal `RC`, `SIGL`, `RESULT`, `SQLCODE`, `SQLSTATE`,
  `SQLERRMC` are reserved for runtime-managed values (see
  [Chapter 14 — Special variables](#chapter-14-rexx-program-structure)).

### Simple variables and NOVALUE

An unset simple variable resolves to its own uppercased name —
the classic REXX `NOVALUE` convention. `SAY X` when `X` has never
been assigned prints `X`. If `SIGNAL ON NOVALUE` is armed (see
[Chapter 18](#chapter-18-conditions-and-signal-on)) the reference
traps instead of resolving to the name.

Assignment is `var = expr`; the right-hand side is evaluated once
and stored verbatim (as a string — REXX has only one runtime
type).

### Stems

A stem is a variable name that ends in `.`. A bare assignment to
the stem (`STEM. = value`) installs a default that any tail
inherits when it has no explicit value. Per-tail values override
the default:

```rexx
STEM. = 'unset'
STEM.42 = 'forty-two'
SAY STEM.1    /* "unset"     -- default       */
SAY STEM.42   /* "forty-two" -- explicit tail */
```

### Compound-symbol tail substitution

Non-numeric tail segments are resolved at every reference. With
`J = 3`, the symbol `A.J` reads or writes `A.3`. The rules:

| Tail segment shape | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| `STEM.42` (numeric) | Literal — the digit run becomes the tail directly. |
| `STEM.NAME` where `NAME` is set | Substituted — value of `NAME` becomes the tail. |
| `STEM.NAME` where `NAME` is **not** set (NOVALUE) | Literal — the bare uppercased name becomes the tail. |
| `STEM.I.J` (multi-segment) | Each segment substituted independently — with `I=1, J=2`, references `STEM.1.2`. |

> The NOVALUE-stays-literal rule is the source of bricks's most
> common porting bug; see
> [Appendix B](#appendix-b-pitfalls-and-idioms) for the
> standard pitfall.

### `DROP`

`DROP name [name …]` removes one or more variables from the
current frame. A trailing dot on a stem name drops the default
AND every tail — useful for resetting an accumulator between
paginated reads:

```rexx
DROP RECS.            /* clear the whole stem    */
DROP A B C            /* drop three simples      */
DROP STEM.42          /* drop just one tail      */
```

### `PROCEDURE` and `EXPOSE`

Inside a `PROCEDURE`, the parent frame's variables are invisible
unless named on the `EXPOSE` list. `EXPOSE` accepts both simple
names and stem roots:

```rexx
GREET: PROCEDURE EXPOSE LANG. SUFFIX
   ...
```

`LANG.` exposes the parent's entire `LANG.` stem (default + all
tails); `SUFFIX` exposes a single simple variable. Exposure is
transitive — a procedure that exposes a name from a caller which
also exposed it from its caller sees the outermost binding.

---

## Chapter 16. Control flow

### `IF` / `THEN` / `ELSE`

```rexx
IF expr THEN stmt-or-block [ELSE stmt-or-block]
```

The `THEN` keyword is mandatory. Both arms accept either a single
statement or a `DO ... END` block. Strict boolean evaluation: the
condition must evaluate to `0` or `1`; anything else raises
`SYNTAX` (so `IF X` where `X = 'foo'` is an error, not a truthy
test).

```rexx
IF AID = 'F3' THEN DO
   EXEC CICS RETURN END-EXEC
   EXIT
END
ELSE
   CALL REFRESH
```

### `SELECT` / `WHEN` / `OTHERWISE` / `END`

```rexx
SELECT
   WHEN expr THEN stmt
   WHEN expr THEN stmt
   ...
   OTHERWISE stmt-or-block
END
```

`WHEN` arms are tested in order; the first match's body runs and
the rest are skipped. `OTHERWISE` is optional but if no `WHEN`
matched and `OTHERWISE` is absent, the runtime raises `SYNTAX`.
Use `OTHERWISE NOP` for an explicit no-op default.

### `DO` family

| Form | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| `DO ... END` | Group several statements as one body (most useful inside `IF` / `WHEN`). |
| `DO N ... END` | Repeat the body `N` times. `N` is any expression that evaluates to a non-negative integer. |
| `DO ctrl = start TO end [BY step] ... END` | Counted loop. `BY` defaults to `1`. The loop runs while `ctrl` is between `start` and `end` (inclusive). `DO ctrl=1 TO 5 BY 0` is rejected at runtime (infinite-loop guard). |
| `DO WHILE expr ... END` | Pre-test loop — body runs while `expr` is truthy. |
| `DO UNTIL expr ... END` | Post-test loop — body runs at least once, then re-tests. |
| `DO FOREVER ... END` | Unbounded; exit only via `LEAVE` / `RETURN` / `EXIT` / `SIGNAL`. |
| `DO ctrl OVER stem. ... END` | Iterate `ctrl` over every set tail of `stem.`. Numeric tails are visited in numeric order, then non-numeric tails in lexicographic order. The default value (`stem. = …`) is not visited. |

The control variable in `DO ctrl =` / `DO ctrl OVER` is set on
each iteration. `LEAVE [ctrl]` and `ITERATE [ctrl]` target either
the innermost loop (no argument) or the loop whose control
variable matches the named argument:

```rexx
DO I = 1 TO 100
   DO J = 1 TO 100
      IF GRID.I.J = '*' THEN ITERATE I  /* skip rest of inner */
   END
END
```

### `CALL` / `RETURN` / `EXIT`

* `CALL name [arg1, arg2, ...]` — call a procedure or a built-in
  function in statement position. Arguments are expressions,
  evaluated left-to-right and made visible to the callee via
  `ARG(n)`. A `CALL` to a built-in throws away the returned
  value; a user procedure's `RETURN expr` populates `RESULT`. The
  same routine can also be called as a function in expression
  position (`x = name(args)`) — see
  [Chapter 14](#chapter-14-rexx-program-structure).
* `RETURN [expr]` — return from a procedure (or terminate a
  top-level program). When `expr` is present and the caller was
  `CALL`, the value lands in `RESULT`; without `expr`, `RESULT`
  is dropped.
* `EXIT [expr]` — terminate the entire program immediately. The
  optional `expr` becomes the process exit code (clamped to a
  byte by the host OS); without it the program exits 0.

### `SIGNAL`

* `SIGNAL label` — non-local jump to a label. Active `DO` /
  `SELECT` / `PROCEDURE` frames are unwound first. `SIGL` is set
  to the source line of the `SIGNAL` statement.
* `SIGNAL ON cond [NAME label]` — arm a condition trap (see
  [Chapter 18](#chapter-18-conditions-and-signal-on)).
* `SIGNAL OFF cond` — disarm.

### `INTERPRET`

`INTERPRET expr` evaluates `expr` to a string and executes that
string as REXX source in the current frame. Labels and
procedures inside the snippet are scoped to that one evaluation
(they do not leak into the surrounding program).

### `NUMERIC`

| Form | Effect |
|---|---|
| `NUMERIC DIGITS n` | Sets the precision used to round arithmetic results. Default 9. |
| `NUMERIC FUZZ n` | Sets the tolerance applied to numeric comparisons. Default 0. |
| `NUMERIC FORM SCIENTIFIC` / `NUMERIC FORM ENGINEERING` | Accepted syntactically but bricks always renders numbers in plain decimal — neither form changes output today. |

Arithmetic is `float64` internally, then rounded to `NUMERIC
DIGITS` significant figures before storing. The `%` and `//`
operators (integer divide and modulo) bypass that rounding.

### `NOP`, `PUSH`, `PULL`, `QUEUE`, `OPTIONS`, `TRACE`

* `NOP` — explicit no-op (clearer than an empty `DO ... END` in
  a `WHEN`).
* `TRACE [opt]` — parsed and accepted but ignored; bricks does
  not run an interpretive tracer.
* `OPTIONS …` — accepted and ignored (no recognised options).
* `PUSH` / `PULL` / `QUEUE` / `PARSE PULL` — accepted; the
  associated terminal data queue is always empty in bricks. Read
  forms return the empty string; write forms are silent no-ops.
  Use `EXEC CICS RECEIVE` for terminal input.

### Bare strings

A bare string at statement position is a command sent to the
current `ADDRESS` environment (see Chapter 14). Outside an active
environment it is a syntax error.

```rexx
ADDRESS CICS
"SEND MAP('CUST1') FROM(SCR.) ERASE"
"RETURN"
```

---

## Chapter 17. PARSE templates

```text
PARSE [UPPER] {VAR var | VALUE expr WITH | ARG | PULL} template
```

The source decides where the input string comes from; the
template decides how it's chopped up and which pieces land in
which variables.

### Sources

| Source | Input string |
|---|---|
| `VAR var` | Current value of the named variable. A compound name resolves its tail — `PARSE VAR airports.CODE …` parses the value of `airports.<CODE>`, not the literal name `AIRPORTS.CODE`. |
| `VALUE expr WITH` | The result of evaluating `expr`. The literal `WITH` keyword separates the source expression from the template. |
| `ARG [, ARG, …]` | The arguments the program (or procedure) was called with. Each comma-separated segment of the template is one argument, in order — `PARSE ARG H, W` peels `ARG(1)` into the first sub-template and `ARG(2)` into the second. |
| `PULL` | The terminal-input queue, which in bricks is always empty. Use `EXEC CICS RECEIVE` for real input. |

`PARSE UPPER` uppercases the source string before splitting it
across the template — convenient for case-insensitive command
parsing.

### Template elements

| Element | Effect |
|---|---|
| Bare variable name | In a *run* of bare variables, all but the last get one blank-delimited word each (leading blanks skipped); the last variable gets the **verbatim** remainder, preserving internal and trailing blanks. A *single* variable with no following anchor receives the whole segment verbatim (leading blanks included). The word separator is the space character only. A dynamic compound target (`A.I`) resolves its tail at assignment time. |
| `.` (period) | Placeholder — consumes one token without binding it. Useful as a "skip" in a variable run. |
| `'literal'` | String anchor. Matches the next occurrence of `literal` in the source and splits there. The literal itself is discarded. |
| `n` (positive integer) | Absolute column marker — jumps to column `n` (1-based) in the source. Variables before the marker get everything from the previous column up to column `n-1`. |
| `+n` / `-n` | Relative column marker — moves the cursor `n` characters forward or backward from the current position. |

### Worked examples

```rexx
/* Whitespace tokens. TID = first word, CKEY = second word,
 * '.' discards the rest of the line.                          */
PARSE VAR LINE TID CKEY .

/* Pipe-delimited fields.                                      */
PARSE VAR REC NM '|' AD '|' CY '|' PH

/* Fixed columns.                                              */
PARSE VAR ROW 1 NAME 21 ADDR 51 PHONE

/* Multi-arg PARSE — peels two call arguments.                 */
GREET: PROCEDURE
   PARSE ARG NAME, GREETING
   SAY GREETING NAME
   RETURN

/* PARSE UPPER on user command, case-insensitive switch.       */
PARSE UPPER VAR LINE VERB REST
SELECT
   WHEN VERB = 'LIST' THEN CALL LIST_HANDLER REST
   WHEN VERB = 'ADD'  THEN CALL ADD_HANDLER  REST
   OTHERWISE SAY 'unknown verb' VERB
END

/* Compound tail resolves on both sides.                       */
I = 2
A.2 = 'hello world'
PARSE VAR A.I W1 W2            /* W1='hello', W2='world'        */

/* Whitespace preserved: the final variable keeps the run of   */
/* blanks between arg1 and arg2 (older PARSE collapsed them).   */
LINE = 'CMD   arg1  arg2'
PARSE VAR LINE VERB REST       /* VERB='CMD', REST='arg1  arg2' */
```

### Not supported

| Feature | Status |
|---|---|
| `PARSE LOWER` | Not parsed (only `UPPER` is). Lowercase the source explicitly with `LOWER(VAR)` then `PARSE VAR`. |
| `PARSE SOURCE` | Not wired — returns empty. |
| `PARSE VERSION` | Not wired — returns empty. |
| `PARSE NUMERIC` | Not wired. |
| Regex / pattern matching in templates | REXX has none; use `POS` / `LASTPOS` + `SUBSTR` for ad-hoc splits. |

---

## Chapter 18. Conditions and SIGNAL ON

```text
SIGNAL ON {ERROR | NOVALUE | SYNTAX | HALT} [NAME label]
SIGNAL OFF cond
SIGNAL label
```

`SIGNAL ON cond [NAME label]` arms a trap. The optional `NAME`
clause picks an explicit handler label; without it, bricks
defaults the handler label to the condition name (so
`SIGNAL ON ERROR` jumps to a label named `ERROR:`).

When a trapped condition fires:

* `SIGL` is set to the source line of the failing statement.
* Control transfers to the handler label, unwinding active
  `DO` / `SELECT` / `PROCEDURE` frames first.
* The trap remains armed for the next occurrence.

`SIGNAL OFF cond` disarms.

### Recognised conditions

| Condition | Fires on |
|---|---|
| `ERROR` | An `EXEC CICS` or `EXEC SQL` command returns a non-zero RC (i.e. the bare-string command path under `ADDRESS CICS`). |
| `NOVALUE` | A reference to a simple or compound variable that has never been assigned. |
| `SYNTAX` | Any other interpreter error — bad numeric, divide by zero, unknown function, out-of-range subscript, ... |
| `HALT` | External halt request. Parsed and reserved; bricks has no fan-in for an external halt today, so the condition never fires. |

`FAILURE`, `NOTREADY`, and `LOSTDIGITS` from standard REXX are
not recognised — `SIGNAL ON FAILURE` parses but never fires.

### Example

```rexx
SIGNAL ON ERROR  NAME CICSERR
SIGNAL ON SYNTAX NAME OOPS

ADDRESS CICS
EXEC CICS READ FILE('CUSTOMERS') INTO(REC) RIDFLD(CKEY) END-EXEC
EXIT

CICSERR:
   SAY 'EXEC CICS failed at line' SIGL ', RC=' RC
   EXIT 12

OOPS:
   SAY 'Interpreter error at line' SIGL
   EXIT 16
```

Without an armed trap, the legacy "test EIBRESP after every verb"
pattern still works. For per-condition (rather than blanket)
traps, use `EXEC CICS HANDLE CONDITION`
([Chapter 10](#chapter-10-recovery-and-condition-handling)); the
two styles can coexist.

---

## Chapter 19. Built-in functions

The bricks REXX interpreter ships with the functions listed
below. A `CALL` to any of these in statement position throws
away the return value; the same name in expression position
returns the value. Built-in lookups are case-insensitive. Per
standard REXX, a user-defined `PROCEDURE` of the same spelling
**takes precedence** over the built-in (the internal routine
shadows it) — for both the `CALL` statement and the `NAME(args)`
function form.

### Length / index

| Signature | Returns |
|---|---|
| `LENGTH(s)` | Byte length of `s`. |
| `POS(needle, hay [, start])` | 1-based byte position of the first occurrence of `needle` in `hay` starting at `start` (default 1), or 0 if not found. |
| `LASTPOS(needle, hay [, end])` | 1-based byte position of the last occurrence at or before `end` (default = end-of-string), or 0. |
| `WORDS(s)` | Number of whitespace-delimited words in `s`. |
| `WORDPOS(phrase, s [, start])` | 1-based word index where `phrase` first appears as a sub-sequence of words, or 0. |
| `WORDINDEX(s, n)` | 1-based character position of the start of word `n`, or 0 if `n` is past the end. |
| `WORDLENGTH(s, n)` | Length of word `n`, or 0. |
| `COUNTSTR(needle, hay)` | Non-overlapping occurrence count. |

### Substring / words

| Signature | Returns |
|---|---|
| `SUBSTR(s, start [, length [, pad]])` | Substring starting at 1-based `start`. With `length`, the result is exactly `length` characters (right-padded with `pad`, default space). Negative `length` raises `SYNTAX`. |
| `LEFT(s, n [, pad])` | Leftmost `n` characters, padded on the right with `pad` (default space). |
| `RIGHT(s, n [, pad])` | Rightmost `n` characters, padded on the left with `pad`. |
| `SUBWORD(s, n [, length])` | Words `n` through `n+length-1` (default: to end). Single space between words in the result. |
| `WORD(s, n)` | Word `n`, or empty string. |
| `DELSTR(s, n [, length])` | `s` with `length` characters from position `n` removed (default: through end). |
| `DELWORD(s, n [, length])` | `s` with `length` words from word `n` removed. |
| `INSERT(new, target [, n [, length [, pad]]])` | Insert `new` into `target` after position `n` (default 0 = prepend), padded to `length` first. |
| `OVERLAY(new, target [, n [, length [, pad]]])` | Overwrite `target` at position `n` with `new`, extending `target` if needed. |
| `CHANGESTR(needle, hay, repl [, count])` | Replace every occurrence (or the first `count`) of `needle` with `repl`. |

### Whitespace / case

| Signature | Returns |
|---|---|
| `STRIP(s [, opt [, ch]])` | Trim characters `ch` (default space) from `L` (left), `T` (right), or `B` (both, default). |
| `SPACE(s [, n [, pad]])` | Collapse internal whitespace; insert `n` copies of `pad` (default 1 space) between words. `n=0` removes whitespace entirely. |
| `CENTER(s, n [, pad])` / `CENTRE(s, n [, pad])` | Centre `s` in a field of width `n`; pad with `pad` (default space). Truncates equally from both ends when `s` is longer than `n`. |
| `JUSTIFY(s, n [, pad])` | Right-justify the last word in width `n`, padding earlier words. |
| `UPPER(s)` / `LOWER(s)` | ASCII case conversion. |
| `REVERSE(s)` | Byte-reverse `s`. |
| `COPIES(s, n)` | `s` repeated `n` times. |
| `ABBREV(s, prefix [, minlen])` | Returns `1` if `prefix` is a prefix of `s` with at least `minlen` characters; else `0`. |

### Translation / bits

| Signature | Returns |
|---|---|
| `TRANSLATE(s [, out [, in [, pad]]])` | Per-character map from `in` to `out`. With no `out`/`in`, uppercases. With only `out`, `in` defaults to `XRANGE()` (the full byte range), giving a per-position translation table. |
| `VERIFY(s, ref [, opt [, start]])` | 1-based position of the first character in `s` (from `start`) that is not in `ref` (`opt='N'`, default) or that IS in `ref` (`opt='M'`); 0 if none. |
| `COMPARE(s1, s2 [, pad])` | 1-based position of the first differing byte after pad-equalising lengths with `pad` (default space); 0 if equal. |
| `XRANGE([from [, to]])` | All bytes from `from` (default `'\x00'`) to `to` (default `'\xFF'`) inclusive. |
| `BITAND(s1 [, s2 [, pad]])` / `BITOR(...)` / `BITXOR(...)` | Bytewise logical operation; lengths equalised with `pad`. |

### Conversion

| Signature | Returns |
|---|---|
| `C2X(s)` | Uppercase hex of every byte. Canonical way to compare `EIBAID` to a PF-key code: `IF C2X(EIBAID) = 'F7' THEN …` (PF7). |
| `X2C(hex)` | Decode `hex` (spaces ignored) to a byte string. |
| `D2X(n [, width])` | Decimal integer to uppercase hex, optionally zero-padded to `width`. |
| `X2D(hex [, n])` | Hex to decimal. With `n`, treats the value as an `n`-digit signed integer (two's complement when the top bit is set). |
| `C2D(s [, n])` | Byte string to decimal. With `n`, signed two's complement over `n` bytes. |
| `D2C(n [, len])` | Integer to byte string, optionally `len` bytes wide. |
| `B2X(bits)` | Bit string (`0`/`1` chars) to hex. |
| `X2B(hex)` | Hex to bit string. |

### Numeric

| Signature | Returns |
|---|---|
| `ABS(n)` | Absolute value. |
| `MAX(n, ...)` | Maximum of all arguments. |
| `MIN(n, ...)` | Minimum of all arguments. |
| `INT(n)` | Integer part (truncate toward zero). |
| `TRUNC(n [, places])` | Truncate to `places` decimal positions (default 0). |
| `MOD(a, b)` | Modulo. Same value as `a // b`. |
| `SIGN(n)` | `-1` if `n<0`, `0` if `n=0`, `+1` if `n>0`. |
| `FORMAT(n [, before [, after [, expp [, expt]]]])` | Numeric formatting with `before` characters in the integer part and `after` decimal places. `expp` / `expt` accepted syntactically but ignored. |
| `DIGITS()` / `FUZZ()` / `FORM()` | Return the current `NUMERIC DIGITS` / `FUZZ` / `FORM` settings. |

### Type / data

| Signature | Returns |
|---|---|
| `DATATYPE(s)` | `'NUM'` if `s` parses as a number; `'CHAR'` otherwise. |
| `DATATYPE(s, 'N')` | `1` / `0` — is `s` numeric? |
| `DATATYPE(s, 'W')` | `1` / `0` — is `s` a whole number? |
| `DATATYPE(s, 'A')` | `1` / `0` — is `s` alphanumeric (letters, digits, no spaces)? |

### Date / time

| Signature | Returns |
|---|---|
| `DATE()` / `DATE('N')` | Today as `dd Mmm yyyy`. |
| `DATE('S')` | Today as `yyyymmdd`. |
| `DATE('E')` | Today as `dd/mm/yy`. |
| `DATE('U')` | Today as `mm/dd/yy`. |
| `DATE('O')` | Today as `yy/mm/dd`. |
| `DATE('B')` | Days since `0001-01-01`. |
| `DATE('B', 'yyyymmdd', 'S')` | Basedate of a given date — subtract two basedates for an exact day delta. |
| `TIME()` / `TIME('N')` | `hh:mm:ss`. |
| `TIME('L')` | `hh:mm:ss.uuuuuu` with microseconds. |
| `TIME('S')` | Seconds since midnight. |

### Variables / arguments

| Signature | Returns |
|---|---|
| `VALUE(name)` | Read the value of the variable named at runtime — useful for indirect reads (`VALUE('SCR.ROW' || J)`). |
| `VALUE(name, newval)` | Set the variable named at runtime; returns the prior value. The two-argument form usually appears under `CALL VALUE 'SCR.ROW' || J, LINE`. |
| `ARG()` | Number of arguments the current procedure was called with. |
| `ARG(n)` | The `n`th argument (1-based), or empty if out of range. |
| `SYMBOL(name)` | Classifies a symbol: `'VAR'` if it names a variable that has a value, `'LIT'` if it is a valid symbol with no value assigned (or a constant symbol such as `77`, `.5` or `3D`, which can never be assigned), `'BAD'` if it is not a valid REXX symbol at all. Evaluation is two-step and stops there: the argument expression is evaluated once and the RESULT is the symbol name, so with `J = 3` `SYMBOL('J')` tests `J` while `SYMBOL(J)` tests the name `3`. Compound tails are derived exactly as an ordinary reference derives them, so `SYMBOL('A.J')` tests `A.3`. The answer is always three uppercase characters. |
| `ADDRESS()` | The name of the current host-command environment, uppercased — `CICS` unless an `ADDRESS` instruction changed it, and restored to the caller's value when a `PROCEDURE` returns. Note that `ADDRESS()` written alone as a whole statement is the ADDRESS *instruction*, not this function; use it inside an expression (`SAY ADDRESS()`). |
| `RANDOM([min [, max]])` | Random integer in `[min, max]` (default `[0, 999]`). |
| `ERRORTEXT(code)` | Echoes the numeric code as a string (placeholder — bricks does not maintain the standard REXX error-text table). |

### Stream I/O

The stream functions read and write text files in the `tmp_dir`
sandbox — the same backend that powers COBOL's `EXEC CICS READQ TD`
/ `WRITEQ TD` / `DELETEQ TD` (see
[Chapter 9](#chapter-9-temporary-storage-and-transient-data-commands)).
The sandbox is strict: ASCII only, LF-terminated, no traversal.

| Function | Form | Behaviour |
|---|---|---|
| `LINEIN(name)` | next line | Auto-opens `name` for read on first call; returns the next line (LF stripped). Empty string at EOF. |
| `LINEIN(name, 1)` | rewind | Closes and reopens `name`, then returns line 1. Only `1` is honoured; any other line number is treated as the "next line" form. |
| `LINEOUT(name)` | close | Closes the named stream. Returns `0`. |
| `LINEOUT(name, line)` | append | Auto-opens `name` for append on first call; appends `line || '\n'`. Returns `0` on success, `1` on error. |
| `LINES(name)` | EOF probe | Returns `1` while more data is available, `0` at EOF. |
| `CHARIN(name, start, n)` | byte read | Reads `n` bytes (default `1`). `start = 1` rewinds first; other `start` values are ignored. |
| `CHAROUT(name, s)` | byte write | Appends raw bytes. Same ASCII/LF validation as `LINEOUT`. |
| `CHARS(name)` | bytes remaining | Returns the file size minus the current read position. |
| `STREAM(name, 'S')` | state | Returns `'READY'`, `'NOTREADY'`, or `'ERROR'`. |
| `STREAM(name, 'D')` | description | Returns a short status string (`'OK'` / parse-time reason). |
| `STREAM(name, 'C', cmd)` | command | `OPEN READ` / `OPEN WRITE` / `OPEN APPEND` / `CLOSE` / `QUERY EXISTS` / `QUERY SIZE` / `DELETE`. |

```rexx
/* Append a row, then read every row back. */
CALL LINEOUT 'export.txt', 'C0000099|WIDGET-Z|7|9.95'
CALL LINEOUT 'export.txt'                   /* close the writer    */
DO WHILE LINES('export.txt') > 0
   SAY LINEIN('export.txt')
END
CALL STREAM 'export.txt', 'C', 'CLOSE'
```

Every handle a program opens is closed automatically at task end;
an interpreter that forgets to call `CLOSE` does not leak
descriptors. A sandbox violation (`'../etc/passwd'`, `'sub/x'`,
leading-dot) causes the next `LINEIN` / `LINEOUT` to raise an
error and `STREAM('S')` to report `'ERROR'`.

### JSON

For programs that consume JSON — typically a REST response read with
`EXEC CICS WEB CONVERSE` — two functions extract values by a dotted
path. They parse the document on each call (fine for the small payloads
a 3270 program renders).

| Signature | Returns |
|---|---|
| `JSONGET(json, path)` | The **scalar** at `path` as a string. `path` is dot-separated; an **integer** segment indexes a JSON array (0-based). Returns `''` for a missing key, an out-of-range index, a JSON `null`, a value that is itself an object/array, or a parse error. JSON numbers render like REXX numbers (`671`, not `671.0`); booleans become `1`/`0`. |
| `JSONCOUNT(json, path)` | The number of elements in the **array** at `path` (the empty path `''` walks the whole document). `'0'` for a missing path, a non-array value, or a parse error. |

```rexx
/* RESP holds the WEB CONVERSE body */
N = JSONCOUNT(RESP, 'data')                 /* array length            */
DO I = 0 TO N - 1
  P   = 'data.' || I
  FLT = JSONGET(RESP, P || '.flight.iata')  /* "BA178"                 */
  DEP = JSONGET(RESP, P || '.departure.iata')
  ARR = JSONGET(RESP, P || '.arrival.iata') /* path-aware: dep != arr  */
END
EMSG = JSONGET(RESP, 'error.message')       /* '' if no error object   */
```

Limitations (acceptable for typical REST payloads): a key containing a
literal `.` is unreachable; array indices are non-negative only (no
wildcards, no negative indices); JSON integers beyond 2^53 lose precision
(they decode through a float). There is no JSON *builder* — assemble
output JSON with string concatenation, as the `WAPI` sample does.

### Operators

Listed lowest to highest precedence. All operators are
left-associative except `**` which is right-associative.

| Precedence | Operators | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 1 (lowest) | `\|` | Logical OR. Strict boolean: both sides must evaluate to `0` or `1`. Short-circuit. |
| 2 | `&` / `&&` | Logical AND. Same strict-boolean rules. `&&` is the strict-AND alias. Short-circuit. |
| 3 | `=` `==` `\=` `\==` `<>` `><` `<` `>` `<=` `>=` | Comparison. The strict variants (`==`, `\==`) compare byte-for-byte; the plain forms compare as numbers when both sides parse as numeric (subject to `NUMERIC FUZZ`) and as trimmed strings otherwise. `\=` and `<>` and `><` are all "not equal". |
| 4 | `\|\|` and juxtaposition | Concatenation. `A \|\| B` joins with no separator; `A B` (whitespace between operands) joins with a single space. There is no zero-separator juxtaposition — write `\|\|` explicitly. |
| 5 | `+` `-` | Addition / subtraction. |
| 6 | `*` `/` `%` `//` | Multiplication, real division, integer division (`%` — truncates toward zero), modulo (`//` — sign of the dividend). |
| 7 | unary `+` `-` `\` | Arithmetic sign and logical NOT. |
| 8 (highest) | `**` | Exponentiation. Integer exponents are exact (via repeated squaring); fractional exponents use float64. |

Comparison precedence note: REXX has no separate equality vs.
ordering precedence, so `A < B = C` parses as `(A < B) = C` —
comparing the boolean result of `A < B` against `C`.

### Restrictions / unsupported

| Feature | Status |
|---|---|
| `TRACE` (interpretive tracer) | Parsed and accepted; bricks does not emit trace output. |
| `OPTIONS` settings (`NOVALUE`, etc.) | Parsed and accepted; have no effect. |
| External function libraries / RXFUNCADD | No dynamic linking — every routine must be a `PROCEDURE` in the program or a built-in. |
| `ADDRESS COMMAND` / `ADDRESS SYSTEM` / `ADDRESS TSO` | Not wired — only `ADDRESS CICS` is recognised. |
| EXECIO and other host-environment I/O | Not provided — use the stream functions (next section) or `EXEC CICS READQ TD / WRITEQ TD` for file I/O. |
| `PARSE PULL` / terminal queue (`PUSH` / `QUEUE`) | Statements are parsed; the queue is always empty. Use `EXEC CICS RECEIVE` for terminal input. |
| `NUMERIC FORM SCIENTIFIC` / `ENGINEERING` | Statement is parsed; rendering is always plain decimal. |
| Strict IEEE arithmetic | Backed by float64 with `NUMERIC DIGITS` rounding, so very large factorials and the like will round before they overflow. |

## Chapter 20. COBOL source format

Bricks ships a free-form COBOL interpreter (`cobol/`) that sits beside
REXX as a second front end on the same `EXEC CICS` surface. The
language-specific layer is `cobol/frame.go`, which adapts COBOL's
group-item world to the REXX-style `STEM.TAIL` lookup the CICS
handlers use.

### Source rules

* **Free-form.** No column 1-72 ruling; no Area A / Area B.
* **Hyphens** are allowed in identifiers (`CUST-RECORD`).
* **Comments** use modern `*>` anywhere on a line, or legacy `*` in
  column 1.
* **Strings** use `'...'` or `"..."` with quote-doubling for
  embedded quotes (`'don''t'`, `"say ""hi"""`).
* **Numeric literals** are decimal digit runs, optionally signed
  (`+`, `-`) when they appear in a context that accepts a signed
  number (`VALUE`, `COMPUTE`, arithmetic verbs). There is no
  COBOL-side decimal-point literal — fractional `VALUE`s use the
  `V` in the PIC plus a digit-run interpreted against that scale.
* **Hex literals** like `X'F3'` and `X"7C"` decode to their byte
  value — used for `IF EIBAID = X'F3'` to check PF3 / PF12 / etc.
  without `C2X(EIBAID) = 'F3'` round-trips.
* **Identifiers** start with a letter or `_`, continue with
  letters, digits, `_`, and `-`. Names are case-insensitive
  (uppercased at parse time).
* **Periods** are scope terminators, not per-statement. The
  parser requires a period after each division header, section
  header, paragraph header, and top-level data item; periods
  inside an explicit `END-IF` / `END-EVALUATE` / etc. body are
  tolerated as inner punctuation, not as scope terminators.

### Divisions

The four divisions parse in their canonical order:

```cobol
       IDENTIFICATION DIVISION.
       PROGRAM-ID. HELC.

       ENVIRONMENT DIVISION.        *> optional, must be empty

       DATA DIVISION.
       WORKING-STORAGE SECTION.
       01 SCR.
          05 INFOLINE PIC X(78).
          05 GREETING PIC X(20).

       PROCEDURE DIVISION.
       MAIN.
           MOVE 'Hello' TO GREETING.
           EXEC CICS SEND MAP('HELO1') FROM(SCR) ERASE END-EXEC.
           EXEC CICS RETURN END-EXEC.
           STOP RUN.
```

`LINKAGE SECTION` is not yet parsed; `DFHCOMMAREA` is auto-injected
as `PIC X(2000)` if the program doesn't declare it (see
`cobol.ensureSystemItems`), so a sub-program can `MOVE DFHCOMMAREA
TO key` immediately. The dispatcher strips trailing space when
reading the COBOL frame's `DFHCOMMAREA` back out, so a fixed-width
buffer round-trips cleanly across an inter-language `EXEC CICS LINK`.

---

## Chapter 21. DATA DIVISION

The DATA DIVISION declares every data item the program touches.
Bricks expects a single `WORKING-STORAGE SECTION` followed by an
optional `LINKAGE SECTION` (`DFHCOMMAREA` is auto-injected when
the program omits it).

### Level numbers

| Level | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `01` | Top-level data item. Owns a self-contained byte buffer. |
| `02` – `49` | Subordinate items inside a group. Children share their parent's buffer at a computed offset. |
| `77` | Standalone elementary item (no children). Functionally equivalent to a flat `01`. |
| `88` | Condition-name attached to the preceding non-88 item (see below). |

The level numbers `66` (RENAMES) and `78` (constant) are **not**
parsed.

### PIC clauses — unedited

Unedited PICs hold raw data: digits, letters, or padded bytes.

| Form | Class | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `X(n)` or `XXXX…` | Alphanumeric | `n` bytes; left-justified, space-padded on `MOVE`. Up to 1 MiB. |
| `A(n)` or `AAA…` | Alphabetic | Same storage as `X(n)`; runtime class-check rejects non-alpha on `INSPECT`-style tests. |
| `9(n)` or `999…` | Numeric (unsigned) | `n` decimal digits; right-justified, zero-padded. Capped at 18 digits (int64 limit). |
| `S9(n)` | Numeric (signed) | Byte 0 holds the sign character (`' '` for positive, `-` for negative); bytes 1..n-1 hold the digits. Cap 18 digits. |
| `9(n)V9(m)` | Numeric with implicit decimal | The `V` is positional — no byte is consumed. Total `n+m` digits stored; arithmetic uses the fixed-point `decimal` type so scale survives `MOVE` / `COMPUTE` / `DISPLAY`. |
| `S9(n)V9(m)` | Signed scaled numeric | Same as above plus a sign byte. |

`(n)` is a repetition count; `9(3)` and `999` are equivalent.

### PIC clauses — edited numeric

Edited PICs hold a formatted representation of a numeric value
suitable for display. Five edit characters are recognised:

| Edit char | Role |
|---|---|
| `Z` | Replace a leading zero with a space (zero suppression). |
| `.` | Insert a literal decimal point at that column. |
| `,` | Insert a thousands separator at that column. |
| `$` | Insert a `$`. A *single* `$` is fixed (always emitted, must be the leftmost character). Two or more in a row *float* — the leftmost is the symbol and slides right to the position immediately before the first significant digit. |
| `*` | Check protection. Replaces a leading zero with `*` instead of a space — used on cheques to prevent forgery. |

**Constraints:**

* At most one suppression family per PIC: `Z`, floating `$`, and
  `*` are mutually exclusive (a single fixed `$` may coexist
  with `Z` — e.g. `$ZZ9.99`).
* `Z` and `*` are forbidden in the fractional half (after the
  `.` insertion).
* The literal width of the mask is the PIC length; total digit
  positions (Z + floating-$ + * + 9) are capped at 18.

**Worked examples:**

| Source | PIC mask | Stored bytes |
|---|---|---|
| `42` | `ZZ9` | `" 42"` |
| `0` | `ZZ9` | `"  0"` |
| `1.5` | `ZZZ.99` | `"  1.50"` |
| `1234.56` | `Z,ZZ9.99` | `"1,234.56"` |
| `12345.67` | `$$$,$$9.99` | `"$12,345.67"` |
| `0.45` | `$$$,$$$.99` | `"      $.45"` |
| `12.34` | `**,**9.99` | `"****12.34"` |
| `42` | `$9999` | `"$0042"` |

When a scaled numeric source is moved through an edited receiver
the source's V-scale is honoured: `MOVE N TO N-Z` where `N` is
`PIC 9(5)V99 VALUE 12345.67` and `N-Z` is `PIC ZZ,ZZ9.99`
stores `"12,345.67"`.

The remaining ANSI edit characters — `+`, `-`, `CR`, `DB`,
`B` (blank), `0` (zero insertion), `/` (slash), and the
`BLANK WHEN ZERO` clause — are not yet supported.

### `VALUE`

`VALUE` declares the initial content of an elementary data item.
Accepted forms:

| Form | Example |
|---|---|
| String literal | `VALUE 'ENTER ID'.` or `VALUE "OK"`. |
| Numeric literal | `VALUE 42.` or `VALUE 0.` (signed `+`/`-` allowed). |
| Figurative | `VALUE SPACES.`, `VALUE ZEROS.`, `VALUE HIGH-VALUES.`, `VALUE LOW-VALUES.`, `VALUE QUOTES.` |

The figurative aliases `SPACE` / `ZERO` / `ZEROES` / `HIGH-VALUE`
/ `LOW-VALUE` / `QUOTE` are normalised to their plural form at
parse time. `VALUE` on a group item is rejected — initialise the
children individually.

#### `VALUE` on a scaled (`V`) item

A **numeric** `VALUE` carries the value, and the PIC's `V` places
it — exactly as `MOVE` and `COMPUTE` do with the same literal:

```cobol
01 A PIC S9(4)V99 VALUE 1.5.      *> 1.50, stored 000150
01 B PIC S9(4)V99 VALUE 2.        *> 2.00, stored 000200
01 C PIC S9(4)   VALUE 1.5.       *> 1, truncated toward zero
```

Do **not** write the stored digit run and expect it to be read as
scaled: `PIC S9(4)V99 VALUE 150` is one hundred fifty, not 1.50.

A **quoted** `VALUE` is byte data and takes the alphanumeric path,
so `VALUE '150'` on that same item is 1.50 — the digits are laid
into the field's bytes rather than scaled. This mirrors
`MOVE '150'`, so a literal means the same thing wherever it is
written.

### Group items

A `01` (or any subordinate level >01) item with one or more
children becomes a group. The group's storage is the
concatenation of its children's storage; the group itself owns
no extra bytes beyond what its children occupy.

```cobol
01 PARENT.
   05 CHILD PIC X(8).
   05 OTHER PIC X(4).
```

`MOVE source TO PARENT` fans out to every elementary child;
`EXEC CICS SEND MAP FROM(PARENT)` walks the children by name to
look up map-field values.

### `OCCURS`

`OCCURS n [TIMES]` declares an array of `n` copies of an item.
The cap is 4096 occurrences per item. Reference one slot with a
1-based subscript expression: `K(I)`, `K(5)`, `K(I + 1)`.
Subscript bounds are checked at runtime. `OCCURS` works on
elementaries and on group items; nested `OCCURS` (an array of
arrays) is **rejected at parse time**.

```cobol
01 TABLE-AREA.
   05 ROW OCCURS 15 TIMES.
      10 K  PIC X(8).
      10 N  PIC X(28).
01 I  PIC 9(4).
...
MOVE 'KEY-A' TO K(1).
MOVE 'KEY-B' TO K(I).
```

### `REDEFINES`

`REDEFINES` overlays a second description on storage that an
earlier item already owns. No new bytes are allocated — the
redefining item and the redefined item are two names for the
same buffer slice, and a `MOVE` through either name is visible
through the other immediately. The PIC of whichever name the
statement references decides how the bytes are interpreted.

```cobol
level data-name-1 REDEFINES data-name-2 [PIC ...] [USAGE ...].
```

The clause must be the first thing after the data name. Rules
bricks enforces at parse time (each mirrors the IBM Enterprise
COBOL rule unless flagged):

* `data-name-1` and `data-name-2` must carry the **same level
  number** (01–49 or 77; never 88).
* `data-name-2` must be the **immediately preceding** item at
  that level under the same parent. Only other redefinitions of
  the same item (with their subordinates and 88s) may sit
  between them.
* Multiple redefinitions all name the **original** item:
  `B REDEFINES A` then `C REDEFINES A` — never `C REDEFINES B`.
* The redefining item must **fit**: its storage may not exceed
  the redefined item's. This holds at level 01 too — stricter
  than IBM, which lets a non-EXTERNAL 01 redefiner grow the
  area (deferred; see Chapter 27). A *shorter* redefiner is
  fine and only overlays the leading bytes.
* Neither item may carry `OCCURS` on its own entry, and neither
  may live inside an `OCCURS` group. **Subordinates of the
  redefining item may carry `OCCURS`** — that subordinate-table
  shape is the main reason the clause exists.
* No `VALUE` anywhere in the redefining item's subtree
  (88-level condition VALUEs are fine). A `VALUE` on the
  *redefined* item is visible through the overlay at startup.
* `FILLER` may redefine (`05 FILLER REDEFINES D8.`); nothing
  can redefine a `FILLER` (it has no referenceable name).
  Likewise the auto-injected system items (`EIB*`, `SQLCA*`,
  `DFHCOMMAREA`) cannot be redefinition targets — they don't
  exist yet when the DATA DIVISION parses.

**Dual view** — one set of bytes, two shapes:

```cobol
01 WS-DATE      PIC 9(8) VALUE 20260611.
01 WS-DATE-R REDEFINES WS-DATE.
   05 WD-YYYY   PIC 9(4).
   05 WD-MM     PIC 9(2).
   05 WD-DD     PIC 9(2).
...
DISPLAY WD-MM.              *> 06
MOVE 12 TO WD-MM.
DISPLAY WS-DATE.            *> 20261211
```

**Row table** — name the rows for the map, subscript them for
the loop. This replaces the unrolled N-branch `EVALUATE`
fan-out that older sample programs carry (see `esdc.cob`):

```cobol
01 SCR.
   05 INFOLINE  PIC X(78).
   05 ROWS-AREA.
      10 ROW1   PIC X(76).
      10 ROW2   PIC X(76).
      10 ROW3   PIC X(76).
   05 R-TAB REDEFINES ROWS-AREA.
      10 ROWV   PIC X(76) OCCURS 3.
...
MOVE WS-LINE TO ROWV(WS-SLOT).
EXEC CICS SEND MAP('ESDS') FROM(SCR) ERASE END-EXEC.
```

`SEND MAP FROM(SCR)` still finds `ROW1`–`ROW3`: map routing
resolves qualified names through storage, and the redefinition
shares their bytes, so whatever the loop wrote through
`ROWV(n)` is what the map paints.

**Storage caveat — signed DISPLAY fields.** bricks stores
`PIC S9(n)` as **n+1 bytes**: byte 0 is a leading separate sign
(`' '` positive, `'-'` negative), bytes 1..n the digits — in
effect `SIGN IS LEADING SEPARATE`, with space standing in for
`+`. IBM's default is n bytes with the sign overpunched into
the trailing digit. A redefinition sees bricks's layout, not
IBM's: the full alphanumeric view of `PIC S9(4)` is `X(5)`,
and it reads `-0123`, sign first. Ported IBM copybooks that
redefine signed DISPLAY fields must be widened by one byte.
`PIC 9(n)`, `COMP` (big-endian two's complement, 2/4/8 bytes)
and `COMP-3` (BCD, C/D/F sign nibble) overlays are byte-for-
byte IBM-faithful — though a `PIC X` view of `COMP` bytes
shows raw binary, exactly as it would on the mainframe.

### `FILLER`

`FILLER` is a reserved name for anonymous storage. Multiple
`FILLER` children under the same parent are allowed (they don't
collide on the duplicate-name check) and they're never
registered in the lookup tables — they can only be addressed
through the parent.

### `USAGE` — DISPLAY vs. COMP vs. COMP-3

Numeric items have three storage layouts:

| `USAGE` | Synonyms | Storage |
|---|---|---|
| `DISPLAY` (default) | — | One byte per digit; signed PICs reserve byte 0 for the sign character (`' '` / `'-'`). The historical bricks layout. |
| `COMP` | `COMPUTATIONAL`, `COMP-4`, `BINARY` | Big-endian two's-complement signed integer packed into 2, 4, or 8 bytes based on the total digit count. |
| `COMP-3` | `COMPUTATIONAL-3`, `PACKED-DECIMAL` | Packed decimal: two BCD digits per byte (high nibble first), with the last byte's low nibble carrying the sign. |
| `POINTER` | `USAGE IS POINTER` | An opaque 4-byte pointer handle, declared **without** a `PIC` clause: `01 WS-PTR USAGE POINTER.`. Holds a CICS storage handle from `EXEC CICS ADDRESS` / `GETMAIN` or an `ADDRESS OF` value. See the [COBOL pointer model](#cobol-pointer-model-usage-pointer--set-address-of) in Chapter 22. |

The `USAGE` keyword is optional — `PIC S9(8) COMP.` and
`PIC S9(8) USAGE IS COMP.` both work. `USAGE` may appear before
or after the `PIC` clause within the same item.

**COMP byte sizing** follows IBM's halfword / fullword /
doubleword convention:

| Total digits (`PIC 9(n)` or `S9(n)V9(m)` → `n+m`) | Bytes |
|---|---|
| 1 – 4 | 2 (halfword) |
| 5 – 9 | 4 (fullword) |
| 10 – 18 | 8 (doubleword) |

`USAGE COMP` requires a numeric PIC (`9` or `S9`); declaring it
on `PIC X(n)` is rejected at parse time. The signed/unsigned
flag does *not* change the byte count — both `PIC 9(4) COMP`
and `PIC S9(4) COMP` occupy two bytes. Bricks always stores the
value as a two's-complement signed int internally.

Scale survives the format transition: a value moved between a
`PIC 9(5)V99` DISPLAY field and a `PIC S9(8)V99 COMP` field
preserves the implicit decimal point. Within the interpreter
every numeric load goes through the fixed-point `decimal`
engine; DISPLAY decodes digits, COMP decodes binary bytes, but
both produce the same `decimal{val, scale}` tuple.

**COMP-3 byte sizing** uses the packed-decimal formula
`ceil((digits + 1) / 2)` — digits plus the trailing sign nibble,
rounded up:

| Total digits | Bytes |
|---|---|
| 1 | 1 |
| 4 | 3 |
| 9 | 5 |
| 15 | 8 |
| 18 | 10 |

The sign nibble follows IBM Enterprise COBOL convention: `0xC`
for signed positive, `0xD` for signed negative, `0xF` for
unsigned. On read, sign nibbles `0xB` and `0xD` are treated as
negative; everything else is positive. Like `COMP`, `COMP-3`
requires a numeric PIC and the digit cap is 18 (the int64
fixed-point engine's ceiling) — `PIC S9(19)` and wider are
parser-rejected.

The canonical mainframe shape `PIC S9(15) COMP-3` is the
standard CICS `EIBABSTIME` carrier:

```cobol
01  SYS-DT  PIC S9(15) COMP-3.
EXEC CICS ASKTIME ABSTIME(SYS-DT) END-EXEC.
EXEC CICS FORMATTIME ABSTIME(SYS-DT) YYYYMMDD(YYYYMMDD) END-EXEC.
```

`ASKTIME` writes the 15-digit ms-since-1900 decimal string into
`SYS-DT`; bricks packs it into 8 BCD bytes transparently.
`FORMATTIME` reads the packed bytes back into the same decimal
string and parses it.

**Other USAGE variants** — `COMP-1` (single-precision float) and
`COMP-2` (double-precision float) are explicitly rejected at
parse time with a "not yet supported" message. `SYNC`,
`INDEXED BY`, and `OCCURS DEPENDING ON` are also unsupported.
(`REDEFINES` IS supported — see the [`REDEFINES`](#redefines)
section above.)

### Level 88 condition-names

A level-88 line declares a boolean condition tied to the
**preceding non-88 data item**. The condition is true when the
parent's current value matches one of the listed values or
falls within a `THRU` range. Reference as a bare name in any
PROCEDURE DIVISION condition (see
[Chapter 22 — 88-level condition names](#88-level-condition-names)
for the runtime behaviour).

```cobol
01  RESP-CODE  PIC 9(3).
    88 RESP-OK        VALUE 0.
    88 RESP-MISSING   VALUE 13.
    88 RESP-RECOVER   VALUES 12, 26, 80.
    88 RESP-FATAL     VALUE 100 THRU 999.
```

`VALUES` (plural) and `VALUE` (singular) are interchangeable.
Multiple values are separated by spaces or commas. `THRU`
(synonym `THROUGH`) declares an inclusive range; ranges and
single values can be mixed:
`88 OK VALUES 0, 1 THRU 5, 9.`

A condition-name lives in its own namespace, separate from data
items. Declaring an 88 whose name collides with an existing
data item is rejected at parse time.

### LINKAGE SECTION

The `LINKAGE SECTION` declares records that are addressed through a
pointer rather than allocated their own storage. Bricks supports
both the classic auto-injected `DFHCOMMAREA` and operator-declared
**based** records redirected with `SET ADDRESS OF`.

**`DFHCOMMAREA`.** Bricks auto-injects `DFHCOMMAREA PIC X(2000)`
when the program doesn't declare it, so a sub-program can
`MOVE DFHCOMMAREA TO key` immediately. The dispatcher strips
trailing space when reading the COBOL frame's `DFHCOMMAREA` back
out, so a fixed-width buffer round-trips cleanly across an
inter-language `EXEC CICS LINK`. `DFHCOMMAREA` is itself a **based**
01 with a default buffer: a program can `MOVE … TO DFHCOMMAREA`
out of the box, *and* redirect it onto another area's bytes with
`SET ADDRESS OF DFHCOMMAREA TO ptr`.

**`DFHEIB`.** The Execute Interface Block is a real `01 DFHEIB`
based block; its children keep the bare IBM names (`EIBRESP`,
`EIBAID`, `EIBCALEN`, `EIBTRMID`, `EIBCPOSN`, …) so a program
references them unqualified exactly as on z/OS. `EXEC CICS ADDRESS
EIB(ptr)` hands back a handle addressing it.

**Based records — `BASED`.** A LINKAGE 01 declared `BASED` owns no
storage of its own:

```cobol
LINKAGE SECTION.
01 CUST-REC BASED.
   05 CUST-NO   PIC X(8).
   05 CUST-NAME PIC X(30).
```

Until the program points it somewhere with
[`SET ADDRESS OF`](#cobol-pointer-model-usage-pointer--set-address-of),
`CUST-REC` is NULL — any read or write through it is a clean
NULL-pointer abend (`ASRA`-style), never a crash. After
`SET ADDRESS OF CUST-REC TO ptr` (where `ptr` came from `GETMAIN`,
`ADDRESS`, or `ADDRESS OF` another item), every reference to
`CUST-NO` / `CUST-NAME` reads and writes the addressed bytes. See
the [COBOL pointer model](#cobol-pointer-model-usage-pointer--set-address-of)
in Chapter 22 for the full surface.

### Cross-group name collisions — `OF` / `IN` qualification

A child name that appears under more than one group is fine; the
parser accepts the declaration and tracks the collision in
`Program.AmbiguousNames`. Unqualified access to such a name is a
runtime error ("ambiguous reference") — disambiguate with `OF`
(or its synonym `IN`):

```cobol
01 SCR.
   05 CUSTNO PIC X(8).
01 DET.
   05 CUSTNO PIC X(8).
...
MOVE 'A1234567' TO CUSTNO OF SCR.
MOVE 'B7654321' TO CUSTNO OF DET.
DISPLAY CUSTNO OF SCR.
```

Single-step qualification (`X OF Y`) picks the matching child
anywhere in `Y`'s subtree; multi-step (`X OF Y OF Z`) chains
through nested groups. Bare names that are unique across the
program continue to work without qualification — the pre-7
`runtime/cobol/gust.cob` convention of prefixed child names
(`DCUSTNO`, `DNAME`, `DMSG`) still compiles and runs, it just
isn't required any more.

A sibling-duplicate (two children of the SAME parent sharing a
name) is still a parse-time error — no qualifier can disambiguate
between siblings of one group.

### Type coercion on `MOVE`

| Source class | Target class | Behaviour |
|---|---|---|
| Alphanumeric → Alphanumeric | `X` / `A` → `X` / `A` | Copy, right-pad with spaces if target is wider; right-truncate if source is wider. |
| Numeric → Numeric | `9` / `S9` → `9` / `S9` | Load through the fixed-point `decimal` engine, rescale to the target's `V` position, store. Truncates high-order if the integer part doesn't fit (silent unless `ON SIZE ERROR` is set on the surrounding verb). |
| Numeric → Edited | `9` / `S9` → `Z` / `$` / `*` / ... | Read the source as a `decimal` (honouring `V`-scale), render the value through the edited mask. |
| Edited → Numeric | `Z` / `$` / `*` / ... → `9` / `S9` | De-edit on read by stripping insertion characters (`,`, `.`, `$`, `*`, spaces) and re-parsing the digits. |
| Alphanumeric → Numeric | `X` → `9` | Best-effort `loadNumeric` — succeeds if the byte content parses as digits after trimming. A letter raises a runtime data exception. |
| Numeric → Alphanumeric | `9` / `S9` → `X` | Source stringified, then alphanumeric-padded. |
| Anything → Group | * → group item | Fans out to every elementary child (recursively). |

A **numeric literal** source follows the Numeric → Numeric row: it
is rescaled to the target's `V` position, so `MOVE 2 TO PIC S9(4)V99`
stores 2.00 and `MOVE 1.5 TO PIC S9(4)` truncates to 1. `MOVE`,
`COMPUTE` and a numeric `VALUE` clause all agree on the same literal.
A **quoted** literal is alphanumeric and takes the byte path instead
(`MOVE '150'` lays those digits into the field's bytes).

### Figurative expansion

`SPACES` → `' '` repeated to fill the target;
`ZEROS` → `'0'` for numeric targets, `\x00` for alphanumeric;
`HIGH-VALUES` → `\xFF`;
`LOW-VALUES` → `\x00`;
`QUOTES` → `'\''`. Group targets compute the fill length from
the sum of the elementary children's storage.

## Chapter 22. PROCEDURE DIVISION

The PROCEDURE DIVISION is a flat list of paragraphs. Each
paragraph is a label (`PARAGRAPH-NAME.`) followed by one or
more statements. Paragraphs are visible to `PERFORM` and
`GO TO`.

### Statement reference

#### Data movement

| Verb | Syntax | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `MOVE` | `MOVE src TO tgt1, tgt2, ...` | One or more targets; fan-out to group children supported. Type coercion table in [Chapter 21 — Type coercion](#type-coercion-on-move). |
| `INITIALIZE` | Not yet supported. | Initialise individual items with `MOVE`. |

#### Arithmetic

Every arithmetic verb accepts the optional clauses `ROUNDED`,
`ON SIZE ERROR ... [END-VERB]`, and `GIVING` (where listed). See
"ROUNDED and ON SIZE ERROR" below.

| Verb | Syntax |
|---|---|
| `COMPUTE` | `COMPUTE tgt [ROUNDED] = expr [ON SIZE ERROR ...] [END-COMPUTE]` |
| `ADD` | `ADD a TO b [GIVING c] [ROUNDED] [ON SIZE ERROR ...] [END-ADD]` |
| `SUBTRACT` | `SUBTRACT a FROM b [GIVING c] [ROUNDED] [ON SIZE ERROR ...] [END-SUBTRACT]` |
| `MULTIPLY` | `MULTIPLY a BY b [GIVING c] [ROUNDED] [ON SIZE ERROR ...] [END-MULTIPLY]` |
| `DIVIDE` (INTO) | `DIVIDE a INTO b [GIVING c] [ROUNDED] [ON SIZE ERROR ...] [END-DIVIDE]` |
| `DIVIDE` (BY) | `DIVIDE a BY b GIVING c [ROUNDED] [ON SIZE ERROR ...] [END-DIVIDE]` |

`REMAINDER` is not yet supported on `DIVIDE`. Arithmetic
expressions support `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `**`, parentheses, and
unary sign.

##### Signed numeric literals

A sign written **immediately** against the digits is part of the
literal, exactly as on IBM, so a signed literal is legal anywhere a
plain one is:

```cobol
MOVE -1 TO WS-IND.
MOVE +5 TO WS-N.
ADD -1 TO WS-COUNT.
DISPLAY -1.
COMPUTE WS-X = -1.5.
IF WS-N = -100 THEN ...
01 WS-LIMIT PIC S9(4) VALUE -150.
```

The spacing is what distinguishes a literal from an operator: `-1`
is a signed literal, `- 1` is the minus operator applied to `1`.
Inside an arithmetic expression both readings work out the same
(`COMPUTE X = A - 1` and `COMPUTE X = -1` are each unambiguous), but
in a list-taking statement they differ — `DISPLAY A -1` displays two
items, while `DISPLAY A - 1` is a parse error, because `DISPLAY`
takes a list of operands, not an expression.

A redundant `+` is not stored, so `DISPLAY +5` prints `5`. Moving a
negative literal into an unsigned `PIC 9` target drops the sign, as
IBM specifies.

#### Control flow

| Verb | Syntax | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `IF` | `IF cond [THEN] stmts [ELSE stmts] [END-IF]` | The period after the last unscoped statement closes the `IF` when `END-IF` is omitted. |
| `EVALUATE` | `EVALUATE subject WHEN val [WHEN val] ... [WHEN OTHER stmts] END-EVALUATE` | Simple value form only — `EVALUATE TRUE` / `FALSE` are rejected at parse time. |
| `PERFORM` | `PERFORM para [THRU para2]` <br> `PERFORM [para] [WITH TEST BEFORE\|AFTER] UNTIL cond` <br> `PERFORM [para] N TIMES` <br> `PERFORM [para] VARYING idx FROM x BY y UNTIL cond [AFTER ...]` <br> …any of the above with the paragraph name omitted and an in-line body closed by `END-PERFORM` | Out-of-line (named paragraph) and in-line (`END-PERFORM`) forms both work. `WITH TEST` is accepted but inert on the `N TIMES` and no-clause shapes. |
| `GO TO` | `GO TO para` | Calculated `GO TO ... DEPENDING ON` not supported. |
| `CONTINUE` | `CONTINUE` | Explicit no-op (used in empty `WHEN OTHER` etc.). |
| `STOP RUN` | `STOP RUN` (or just `STOP`) | Terminate the task. |
| `GOBACK` | `GOBACK` | Synonym for `EXIT PROGRAM`. |
| `EXIT` | `EXIT [PROGRAM]` <br> `EXIT PERFORM [CYCLE]` | `EXIT` alone is a no-op; `EXIT PROGRAM` returns to the caller. `EXIT PERFORM` leaves the innermost **in-line** `PERFORM`, `EXIT PERFORM CYCLE` ends only the current iteration. `EXIT PARAGRAPH` / `EXIT SECTION` are not supported. |

#### Strings

| Verb | Syntax |
|---|---|
| `STRING` | `STRING src1 [DELIMITED BY (SIZE \| 'lit')] src2 ... INTO tgt [ON OVERFLOW stmts] [END-STRING]` |
| `UNSTRING` | `UNSTRING src DELIMITED BY 'lit' INTO t1 t2 ... [ON OVERFLOW stmts] [END-UNSTRING]` |
| `INSPECT TALLYING` | `INSPECT subject TALLYING counter FOR (ALL \| LEADING \| CHARACTERS) [needle] [BEFORE/AFTER INITIAL delim] [, ...]` |
| `INSPECT REPLACING` | `INSPECT subject REPLACING (ALL \| LEADING \| FIRST \| CHARACTERS) [needle] BY replacement [BEFORE/AFTER INITIAL delim] [, ...]` |
| `INSPECT CONVERTING` | `INSPECT subject CONVERTING from TO to [BEFORE/AFTER INITIAL delim]` |

#### I/O and external

| Verb | Syntax | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `DISPLAY` | `DISPLAY item1 item2 ...` | Concatenates items with no separator; newline after the list. |
| `ACCEPT` | Not yet supported. | Use `EXEC CICS RECEIVE` for terminal input. |
| `EXEC CICS` | `EXEC CICS verb operand-list END-EXEC` | Same verb set as REXX. See Parts 4–5 and 7. |
| `EXEC SQL` | `EXEC SQL stmt END-EXEC` | See Part 6. |
| `CALL`, `SEARCH`, `ALTER` | Not yet supported. | |

Every target name above (the second operand of `MOVE`, the
target of `COMPUTE` / `ADD` / `SUBTRACT` / `MULTIPLY` / `DIVIDE` /
`GIVING` / `STRING INTO` / `UNSTRING INTO` / `INSPECT`, and the
subject of `EVALUATE` / `IF`) accepts qualification via `OF` /
`IN` (see the
[Data Division](#chapter-21-data-division) section on globally
non-unique names) and subscripts via `(idx)` for OCCURS-resident
items.

### Reference modification (string slicing)

`identifier(start:length)` addresses a byte window inside a data
item. Positions are **1-indexed**, `length` is a count of bytes, and
both operands may be any integer arithmetic expression — literals,
data-names, or `WS-POS + 1`. Omitting the length (`identifier(start:)`)
means "from `start` to the end of the item", padding included.

Slices work on both sides of a statement:

```cobol
01 WS-LINE  PIC X(80) VALUE 'HELLO WORLD'.
01 WS-PART  PIC X(5).
01 WS-POS   PIC 9(2)  VALUE 7.

    MOVE WS-LINE(1:5)      TO WS-PART        *> read  -> 'HELLO'
    MOVE WS-LINE(WS-POS:5) TO WS-PART        *> read  -> 'WORLD'
    MOVE '*'               TO WS-LINE(6:1)   *> write -> 'HELLO*WORLD'
    IF WS-LINE(6:1) = SPACE THEN ...          *> test one byte
```

A write touches **only** the named window; the bytes on either side
keep their contents. That makes `MOVE ch TO BUF(POS:1)` the natural way
to render a screen row one character at a time, without an `OCCURS`
table or `REDEFINES` overlay.

Three rules worth knowing:

- **A slice is always category alphanumeric**, whatever the item's own
  PIC says. `NUM-FLD(1:1)` compares as bytes, so `IF NUM-FLD(1:1) = '1'`
  is the correct test and `= 1` is not. On a write, the value is
  left-justified and space-padded to the window width — never
  right-justified or zero-filled, even into a `PIC 9` item.
- **A `USAGE COMP` / `COMP-3` item is sliced through its decimal
  rendering**, not its raw bytes: `PIC 9(4) COMP VALUE 1234`, sliced
  `(1:2)`, yields `'12'`.
- **Out-of-range windows are errors.** A read whose length overruns the
  item is space-padded, but a start below 1 or past the end of the item
  aborts the transaction, as does any write whose window would run past
  the item's last byte — those bytes belong to the next field in the
  same `01` and silently overwriting them corrupts it.

### ROUNDED and ON SIZE ERROR

`ROUNDED` applied to `COMPUTE` and the four arithmetic verbs rounds
the final value half-away-from-zero to the destination's PIC scale
instead of truncating toward zero (the unROUNDED default).

`ON SIZE ERROR` runs its statement list when the calculation
overflows the int64 fixed-point engine, the result's integer-part
digits don't fit in the target PIC, or a `DIVIDE` divisor is zero;
when present, the destination is left untouched on a size-error
firing. Without an `ON SIZE ERROR` branch the value is silently
truncated/wrapped as before so existing programs aren't disrupted.

### PERFORM N TIMES and PERFORM VARYING

```cobol
PERFORM FILL-ROW 15 TIMES.

PERFORM FILL-ROW
    VARYING I FROM 1 BY 1 UNTIL I > 15.
```

`PERFORM ... N TIMES` runs the named paragraph exactly N times; N
can be a numeric literal or a numeric data item. `PERFORM ...
VARYING idx FROM x BY y UNTIL cond` initialises `idx` to `x`,
runs the body while `cond` is false, then increments `idx` by `y`
between iterations.

### In-line PERFORM

Leave the paragraph name out and the loop body sits between the
`PERFORM` and a mandatory `END-PERFORM`:

```cobol
PERFORM UNTIL WS-DONE = 'Y'
    COMPUTE WS-N = WS-N + 1
    IF WS-N > 9 THEN
        MOVE 'Y' TO WS-DONE
    END-IF
END-PERFORM.

PERFORM 10 TIMES
    COMPUTE WS-TOT = WS-TOT + 1
END-PERFORM.

PERFORM VARYING I FROM 1 BY 1 UNTIL I > 15
    MOVE SPACES TO ROW-TEXT(I)
END-PERFORM.
```

All four loop shapes work in-line — no clause (the body runs once),
`UNTIL`, `N TIMES`, and `VARYING`. In-line and out-of-line `PERFORM`
nest freely in either direction.

`END-PERFORM` is **required** on the in-line form: unlike `IF`, a
period does not close it. A period inside the body ends the sentence
and is reported as `in-line PERFORM needs END-PERFORM`.

### PERFORM THRU

```cobol
PERFORM WORK-A THRU WORK-EXIT.
```

Runs every paragraph from `WORK-A` through `WORK-EXIT` in source
order, then returns. `THROUGH` is accepted as a synonym. This enables
the classic early-return idiom — a `GO TO` aimed at a paragraph
**inside** the range transfers control there and the range still
returns to the caller when its last paragraph ends:

```cobol
PERFORM CHECK-IT THRU CHECK-EXIT.
...
CHECK-IT.
    IF WS-AMT = 0 THEN
        GO TO CHECK-EXIT
    END-IF.
    COMPUTE WS-FEE = WS-AMT * 2.
CHECK-EXIT.
    EXIT.
```

A `GO TO` aimed **outside** the range still abandons the `PERFORM`
and restarts at the target, which is bricks' general `GO TO`
behaviour (see [Periods and GO TO](#periods)). A backwards range
(`PERFORM Z THRU A`) is rejected at run time.

### WITH TEST BEFORE / AFTER

```cobol
PERFORM WITH TEST AFTER UNTIL WS-RESP = DFHRESP(NORMAL)
    EXEC CICS READ FILE('CUSTOMER') INTO(WS-REC)
             RIDFLD(WS-KEY) RESP(WS-RESP) END-EXEC
END-PERFORM.
```

`WITH TEST BEFORE` is the default: the condition is tested at the top,
so a condition that is already true runs the body zero times. `WITH
TEST AFTER` tests at the bottom, so the body always runs at least
once. `WITH` is optional (`TEST AFTER` alone is accepted). It applies
to the `UNTIL` and `VARYING` shapes; on `N TIMES` and the no-clause
form it is accepted but has no effect.

On a post-tested `VARYING` the flow is body → test → augment, so the
index is left at its last in-range value rather than one step past
the limit.

### EXIT PERFORM

```cobol
PERFORM VARYING I FROM 1 BY 1 UNTIL I > 100
    IF TBL-KEY(I) = WS-WANTED THEN
        MOVE I TO WS-HIT
        EXIT PERFORM
    END-IF
    IF TBL-KEY(I) = SPACES THEN
        EXIT PERFORM CYCLE
    END-IF
    COMPUTE WS-SCANNED = WS-SCANNED + 1
END-PERFORM.
```

`EXIT PERFORM` breaks out of the innermost in-line `PERFORM`;
`EXIT PERFORM CYCLE` ends only the current iteration and continues
with the next one (still reaching a `VARYING` augment, so the loop
advances rather than spinning).

Both are scoped to the **in-line** `PERFORM` that lexically contains
them, matching IBM. An `EXIT PERFORM` written in a performed
*paragraph* is a program error, not a way to break the caller's loop,
and is reported as `EXIT PERFORM outside an in-line PERFORM`.

### PERFORM VARYING ... AFTER

```cobol
PERFORM VARYING I FROM 1 BY 1 UNTIL I > 4
          AFTER J FROM 1 BY 1 UNTIL J > 3
    COMPUTE SLOT((I - 1) * 3 + J) = I * J
END-PERFORM.
```

Each `AFTER` adds an inner dimension. Inner indices are re-initialised
to their `FROM` value on every iteration of the dimension outside
them, so the example above runs the body 12 times. `AFTER` may be
repeated for further dimensions. A plain `EXIT PERFORM` unwinds the
whole nest, not just the innermost dimension.

> ⚠️ bricks rejects nested `OCCURS`, so a two-dimensional walk
> addresses a flat table with a computed subscript as shown above
> rather than `SLOT(I, J)`.

### OCCURS arrays

```cobol
01 TABLE-AREA.
   05 ROW OCCURS 15 TIMES.
      10 K  PIC X(8).
      10 N  PIC X(28).
01 I  PIC 9(4).
...
MOVE 'KEY-A' TO K(1).
MOVE 'KEY-B' TO K(I).
PERFORM SHOW-ROW VARYING I FROM 1 BY 1 UNTIL I > 15.
```

`OCCURS n TIMES` declares `n` copies of an item; references add a
parenthesised 1-based subscript expression that picks one. The
subscript can be any numeric expression — a literal, a data item, or
arithmetic — and is bounds-checked at runtime. Subscripts work on
group items (`ROW(5)`) and on elementaries inside the OCCURS group
(`K(5)`) alike. The cap is 4096 occurrences per item; nested
OCCURS (an OCCURS group inside another OCCURS group) is rejected at
parse time.

### Periods

Periods are scope-terminators, not per-statement: a statement inside
an `IF ... END-IF` body has no period; only the unscoped statement
at the paragraph level does.

### Postfix NOT

IBM-style postfix NOT (`X NOT = Y`, `X NOT > Y`) is supported in
`IF` / `EVALUATE` / `PERFORM UNTIL` conditions.

### Relational operators

Both symbolic and English-spelled relational operators are accepted
in `IF`, `EVALUATE WHEN`, and `PERFORM UNTIL` conditions. The two
styles are interchangeable; legacy CICS applications typically use
the English spelling.

The optional words `IS`, `THAN`, and `TO` are noise — present or
omitted without changing meaning. `NOT` may prefix any operator and
appears before or after `IS` (`IF X IS NOT EQUAL TO Y`).

| Meaning              | Symbolic        | English-spelled forms (noise words bracketed) |
|---|---|---|
| equal                | `=`             | `[IS] EQUAL [TO]`                              |
| not equal            | `<>`, `NOT =`   | `[IS] NOT EQUAL [TO]`                          |
| greater              | `>`             | `[IS] GREATER [THAN]`                          |
| not greater (≤)      | `NOT >`         | `[IS] NOT GREATER [THAN]`                      |
| less                 | `<`             | `[IS] LESS [THAN]`                             |
| not less (≥)         | `NOT <`         | `[IS] NOT LESS [THAN]`                         |
| greater or equal     | `>=`            | `[IS] GREATER [THAN] OR EQUAL [TO]`            |
| less or equal        | `<=`            | `[IS] LESS [THAN] OR EQUAL [TO]`               |

The four lines below are equivalent — all four compile to the same
comparison and run identically:

```cobol
IF WK-MTH = 7         DISPLAY 'JULY'.
IF WK-MTH EQUAL 7     DISPLAY 'JULY'.
IF WK-MTH EQUAL TO 7  DISPLAY 'JULY'.
IF WK-MTH IS EQUAL TO 7  DISPLAY 'JULY'.
```

### Class condition tests

`X IS [NOT] {NUMERIC | ALPHABETIC | ALPHABETIC-UPPER | ALPHABETIC-LOWER}`
tests the current **byte contents** of a data item against a
character class — not its static `PIC` class. A `PIC 9(4)` field
holding `0000` is NUMERIC; the same field after a partial move
that injects letters is not.

`IS` is optional noise; `NOT` negates as in any other condition.

```cobol
IF WS-INPUT IS NUMERIC
   PERFORM CALC
ELSE
   DISPLAY 'NON-NUMERIC INPUT'.
IF WS-NAME IS ALPHABETIC
   PERFORM ACCEPT-NAME.
```

`ALPHABETIC` accepts uppercase letters, lowercase letters, and
space. `ALPHABETIC-UPPER` and `ALPHABETIC-LOWER` restrict to
their case (plus space). For `PIC S9` signed numerics the byte 0
sign position is allowed to hold `' '`, `'+'`, or `'-'`.

### Sign condition tests

`X IS [NOT] {POSITIVE | NEGATIVE | ZERO}` tests the numeric sign
of a numeric expression. The operand must be a numeric data
item (`PIC 9...` or `PIC S9...`) or a numeric expression; a
sign test on a non-numeric operand is a runtime error rather
than a silent false.

```cobol
IF WS-BALANCE IS NEGATIVE
   DISPLAY 'OVERDRAWN'.
IF AMOUNT IS ZERO
   PERFORM SKIP-ENTRY.
```

Signed zero is neither POSITIVE nor NEGATIVE; an unsigned PIC
(`PIC 9...` without `S`) can never be NEGATIVE — that short-
circuits to false without inspecting the value.

### 88-level condition names

A level-88 line in DATA DIVISION declares a boolean condition
tied to the **preceding non-88 data item**. The condition is
true when the parent's current value matches one of the listed
values or falls within a `THRU` range. Reference as a bare name
in any PROCEDURE DIVISION condition.

```cobol
       DATA DIVISION.
       WORKING-STORAGE SECTION.
       01  RESP-CODE  PIC 9(3).
           88 RESP-OK        VALUE 0.
           88 RESP-MISSING   VALUE 13.
           88 RESP-RECOVER   VALUES 12, 26, 80.
           88 RESP-FATAL     VALUE 100 THRU 999.
       PROCEDURE DIVISION.
       MAIN.
           EXEC CICS READ FILE('CUSTOMER')
                          INTO(REC) RIDFLD(KEY)
                          RESP(RESP-CODE) END-EXEC.
           IF RESP-OK
              CONTINUE
           ELSE IF RESP-RECOVER
              PERFORM RETRY
           ELSE IF RESP-FATAL
              PERFORM ABEND.
```

`VALUES` (plural) and `VALUE` (singular) are interchangeable.
Multiple values may be separated by commas or by spaces. `THRU`
(synonym `THROUGH`) declares an inclusive range; ranges and
single values can be mixed in one declaration:
`88 OK VALUES 0, 1 THRU 5, 9.`

Comparison style follows the parent's PIC class — numeric
parents compare numerically, alphanumeric parents compare
byte-by-byte (after rstripping trailing spaces). `NOT` and the
AND/OR connectives compose normally:
`IF NOT RESP-OK OR RESP-FATAL`.

A condition-name lives in its own namespace, separate from data
items — `01 STATUS PIC X.` and `88 STATUS-OK VALUE 'Y'.` are
two different lookups. Declaring an 88 whose name collides with
an existing data item is rejected at parse time.

### Intrinsic functions

The shipped intrinsic library is:

| Function | Args | Result |
|---|---|---|
| `FUNCTION UPPER-CASE(s)` | 1 alphanumeric | s uppercased. |
| `FUNCTION LOWER-CASE(s)` | 1 alphanumeric | s lowercased. |
| `FUNCTION TRIM(s)` | 1 alphanumeric | s with leading and trailing spaces removed (both ends; one-arg form). |
| `FUNCTION REVERSE(s)` | 1 alphanumeric | s reversed (rune-aware). |
| `FUNCTION LENGTH(s)` | 1 alphanumeric | numeric byte length of the operand's storage (PIC X(8) → 8). |
| `FUNCTION NUMVAL(s)` | 1 alphanumeric | numeric value of s after stripping leading / trailing whitespace; errors on non-numeric content (does not silently coerce to zero). |
| `FUNCTION POS(needle, haystack)` | 2 alphanumeric | 1-based byte position of needle in haystack, or 0 when not found. Mirrors REXX's `POS()`. Empty needle returns 0. |

Numeric-returning intrinsics (`LENGTH`, `NUMVAL`, `POS`) participate
in `IF` / `EVALUATE` / arithmetic comparisons as numeric operands, so
`IF FUNCTION POS(NEEDLE, HAY) > 0` works without an intermediate
`COMPUTE`. The remaining intrinsics return alphanumeric and compare
by bytes (rstripped).

`FUNCTION POS` is the substring-search hook used by
`runtime/cobol/gusl.cob` to filter the customers file when the
operator types a search term at GUST's `S` action.

### INSPECT

```cobol
INSPECT subject TALLYING counter FOR (ALL | LEADING | CHARACTERS)
                                     [needle] [BEFORE/AFTER INITIAL delim]
                                     [, ...]
INSPECT subject REPLACING (ALL | LEADING | FIRST | CHARACTERS)
                          [needle] BY replacement
                          [BEFORE/AFTER INITIAL delim]
                          [, ...]
INSPECT subject CONVERTING from TO to
                          [BEFORE/AFTER INITIAL delim]
```

Quantifiers:

* **ALL** — every occurrence of `needle` (TALLYING) or every
  occurrence rewritten (REPLACING).
* **LEADING** — only successive occurrences at the start of the
  in-scope region.
* **FIRST** — only the first occurrence (REPLACING only).
* **CHARACTERS** — every character in the in-scope region; for
  TALLYING this just counts characters, for REPLACING it overwrites
  each one with the first byte of `replacement`.

Limiters:

* **BEFORE INITIAL delim** narrows the in-scope region to everything
  before the first occurrence of `delim`.
* **AFTER INITIAL delim** narrows to everything after the first
  occurrence of `delim`.

Both can be set on the same phrase; AFTER picks the start, BEFORE
picks the end.

Multiple phrases can be combined per statement, optionally separated
by commas:

```cobol
INSPECT REC REPLACING ALL ',' BY '|' ALL ';' BY '/'.
INSPECT REC TALLYING C FOR LEADING '0', ALL 'X' AFTER INITIAL ' '.
```

Counter behaviour: TALLYING **accumulates** — successive `INSPECT
TALLYING` statements add to the existing counter value rather than
resetting, matching IBM semantics. REPLACING phrases run left-to-
right in declared order, so later phrases see the output of earlier
ones.

Converting: `CONVERTING from TO to` builds a positional per-character
map and translates every character of the in-scope region through it —
`from[k]` becomes `to[k]`, exactly like Unix `tr` or the old COBOL
`TRANSFORM`. This is the verb for case folding:

```cobol
INSPECT VMUSR CONVERTING 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
                      TO 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'.
```

If `from` repeats a character, the **leftmost** occurrence defines its
mapping and later duplicates are ignored. The sets need not be the same
length: only the overlapping `min(len(from), len(to))` positions map and
any surplus is silently ignored (no runtime error), matching the
REPLACING leniency philosophy. IBM allows only **one** CONVERTING phrase
per INSPECT (no comma list), and `BEFORE/AFTER INITIAL delim` narrows the
region just like REPLACING.

Subject, counter, and operands all accept qualified data-names
(`INSPECT REC OF DET ...`). Trailing PIC X padding is rstripped from
both the subject and the needle before matching, so a 30-byte filter
containing `FOO` plus trailing spaces matches against the meaningful
content of the subject rather than against the padding.

IBM's CONVERTING form is now supported (see the Converting paragraph
above).

### EVALUATE limitations

`EVALUATE` only supports the simple value form. `EVALUATE TRUE` /
`EVALUATE FALSE` is rejected at parse time with a hint to rewrite as
`IF/ELSE` — those forms (and `WHEN ... THRU ...` ranges,
multi-subject `ALSO` clauses, condition-name arms) are deferred.

---

### COBOL pointer model: `USAGE POINTER` / `SET ADDRESS OF`

Bricks implements the IBM COBOL/CICS pointer surface so a program
can address dynamically allocated or CICS-owned storage. **Pointers
are opaque handles, not machine addresses** — there is no pointer
arithmetic and they are not displayable numbers.

#### `USAGE POINTER` items

Declared with no `PIC` clause:

```cobol
01 WS-PTR  USAGE POINTER.        *> 'USAGE IS POINTER' also accepted
```

A pointer occupies a 4-byte fullword slot and starts **NULL**. Its
value comes from `EXEC CICS ADDRESS` / `GETMAIN`, from
`ADDRESS OF identifier`, or from another pointer; it can be compared
against `NULL` and against `ADDRESS OF X`, and moved like any other
item. (Internally a pointer's value is a small integer handle; the
program never sees or depends on the integer.)

#### `ADDRESS OF identifier`

`ADDRESS OF X` is the address of data item `X` — usable on the right
of `SET`, and in an equality test:

```cobol
SET WS-PTR TO ADDRESS OF WS-REC.
IF WS-PTR = ADDRESS OF WS-REC THEN DISPLAY 'same' END-IF.
```

`ADDRESS OF` of the same item always compares equal (handles are
interned), so pointer equality is meaningful.

#### `NULL` / `NULLS`

The figurative `NULL` (synonym `NULLS`) is the null pointer:

```cobol
SET WS-PTR TO NULL.
IF WS-PTR = NULL THEN DISPLAY 'unset' END-IF.
```

A freshly declared `USAGE POINTER` item, and any based 01 that has
not been pointed anywhere, are NULL.

#### `SET P TO {ADDRESS OF X | NULL | ptr}`

Assigns a pointer variable: to the address of an item, to NULL, or
to the value of another pointer.

#### `SET ADDRESS OF L TO {ptr | ADDRESS OF X | NULL}`

Redirects a **based** LINKAGE 01 onto bytes. After the SET, every
reference to `L`'s children reads / writes the addressed storage:

```cobol
LINKAGE SECTION.
01 GM-AREA BASED.
   05 GM-TEXT PIC X(16).
PROCEDURE DIVISION.
    EXEC CICS GETMAIN SET(WS-PTR) FLENGTH(16) END-EXEC.
    SET ADDRESS OF GM-AREA TO WS-PTR.    *> map the record onto the buffer
    MOVE 'POINTER-OK' TO GM-TEXT.        *> writes into the GETMAIN bytes
```

`SET ADDRESS OF L TO NULL` un-addresses `L`; a subsequent read or
write through `L` raises a **clean NULL-pointer abend** — the task
ends with a diagnostic, the server never crashes. The same applies
to a based 01 that was never SET, and to dereferencing through a
pointer whose GETMAIN buffer was already `FREEMAIN`-ed.

#### Based LINKAGE 01s, `DFHEIB`, `DFHCOMMAREA`

`DFHCOMMAREA` and `DFHEIB` are themselves based 01s.
`DFHCOMMAREA` ships with a default buffer (so a plain
`MOVE … TO DFHCOMMAREA` works without any SET) yet can be
redirected: `SET ADDRESS OF DFHCOMMAREA TO ADDRESS OF WS-NEW`.
`DFHEIB`'s children keep the bare IBM names so `EIBRESP`,
`EIBCALEN`, etc. are referenced unqualified. See
[LINKAGE SECTION](#linkage-section) in Chapter 21.

#### `SET ptr UP BY n` / `SET ptr DOWN BY n` — pointer arithmetic

`SET ptr UP BY n` advances a `USAGE POINTER` item by `n` bytes;
`SET ptr DOWN BY n` moves it back. `n` is a **non-negative integer**
displacement — a literal, a data item, or an arithmetic expression that
evaluates to a whole number (the same evaluator `COMPUTE` uses). A
non-integer (e.g. `1.5`) or a negative amount is rejected at `SET` time;
`UP`/`DOWN` carry the direction, so use `DOWN BY n` rather than `UP BY -n`:

```cobol
01 WS-REC PIC X(10) VALUE 'AAAAAAAAAA'.
01 P      USAGE POINTER.
01 L BASED.
   05 L-FLD PIC X(6).
...
    SET P TO ADDRESS OF WS-REC.
    SET P UP BY 4.                 *> P now addresses byte 4 of WS-REC
    SET ADDRESS OF L TO P.
    MOVE 'XXXXXX' TO L-FLD.        *> writes WS-REC bytes 4..9
    SET P DOWN BY 4.               *> back to the start of WS-REC
```

**Nuance — arithmetic stays within the pointer's current target
buffer.** Bricks pointers are interned `(buffer, offset)` handles, not
flat region addresses, so `UP`/`DOWN BY` adjusts the offset *inside the
same buffer* the pointer already names; it does not let you walk across
unrelated allocations. Moving a pointer past the end of its buffer is
allowed at `SET` time (the address is interned, never validated), but a
**dereference** through it raises a clean bounds abend — exactly as with
any out-of-range based access. Moving below offset `0`, or arithmetic on
a NULL/never-set pointer, raises a clean diagnostic at `SET` time. To
walk an array inside a GETMAIN buffer you may still prefer a based 01
with an `OCCURS` table and subscript it, which keeps the bounds check
per element.

See [`EXEC CICS ADDRESS`](#address--exec-cics-address) and
[`GETMAIN` / `FREEMAIN`](#getmain--freemain--exec-cics-getmain-exec-cics-freemain)
in Chapter 6 for the verbs that produce pointer handles, and
`runtime/cobol/gmpt.cob` (TRANSID `GMPT`) for a worked example.

## Chapter 23. The EIB block in COBOL

`EIBRESP`, `EIBRESP2`, `EIBAID`, `EIBCPOSN`, `EIBCALEN`, `EIBTRMID`,
`RC`, and `DFHCOMMAREA` are auto-injected if not declared, so most
programs need no boilerplate. After every `EXEC CICS`, `EIBRESP`
and `EIBRESP2` are populated by the handler the same way they are
for REXX. The legacy "test `EIBRESP` after every verb" pattern is
the most common idiom; for non-local error handling without a REXX-style
`SIGNAL ON ERROR`, use `EXEC CICS HANDLE CONDITION` /
`EXEC CICS HANDLE ABEND` ([Chapter 10](#chapter-10-recovery-and-condition-handling)).

See [Chapter 11](#chapter-11-the-execute-interface-block-eib) for
the field meanings.

---

## Chapter 24. EXEC CICS in COBOL

The COBOL parser collects every token between `EXEC CICS` and
`END-EXEC` and reconstructs the body verbatim for the same
`cics.ParseCommand` REXX uses. Three consequences:

* **Map-field names must match group-child names exactly.** When
  `EXEC CICS SEND MAP('CUST1') FROM(SCR)` fires, the CICS handler
  asks the frame for `SCR.INFOLINE`, `SCR.MSG`, etc. — so SCR must
  have children spelled exactly as the map declares fields. Real
  COBOL solves this with BMS-generated copybooks; bricks doesn't
  ship those, so the operator declares fields by hand.

* **`DFHCOMMAREA` is the COMMAREA marshalling slot.** Caller passes
  bytes in via the frame; sub-program reads with
  `MOVE DFHCOMMAREA TO ...`, mutates a working copy, and
  `MOVE ... TO DFHCOMMAREA`. Trailing space is stripped by the
  dispatcher on the way back out.

* **Command-line arguments arrive via `EXEC CICS RECEIVE
  INTO(...)`.** When the operator types `EXAM 1 2 3` at the blank
  prompt, the dispatcher hands the unedited line (TRANSID prefix
  included) to the first task in the chain. The program reads it
  with `EXEC CICS RECEIVE INTO(WS-INPUT) LENGTH(WS-LEN) END-EXEC`
  and parses with `UNSTRING WS-INPUT DELIMITED BY ' ' INTO TRANSID
  A B C END-UNSTRING`. Single-shot per task, then `EOC`. See
  `runtime/cobol/exam.cob`.

`EXEC CICS SEND TEXT FROM(area) [ERASE]` works the same way.
Reconstruction routes through the shared `cics.Handler`, so any verb
REXX can issue, COBOL can issue too. The body is laid out as a flat
row-major buffer (every `cols` bytes = one row, default 80) — 3270
has no LF, so build `area` as a group of `PIC X(80)` children and
fill them row by row, or compose a single `PIC X(n*80)` with a
matching `MOVE` per row.

The full `EXEC CICS` verb set is documented in
[Part 2](#part-2-exec-cics-command-reference); behaviour is identical
between REXX and COBOL.

---

## Chapter 25. Copybooks

A copybook is a fragment of COBOL source — typically declarations
for constants and groups — kept in a separate file and pulled into
a program at parse time with a single line:

```cobol
       WORKING-STORAGE SECTION.
       COPY DFHAID.
       COPY DFHRESP.
       01 OWN-COUNTER PIC 9(4).
```

bricks expands every `COPY name.` directive at the source-text
level before the lexer runs, so the rest of the parser sees one
unbroken stream of COBOL.

### The COPY directive

Syntax:

```cobol
       COPY <name>.
```

* The directive must be on its own line. Anything before or after
  the `COPY` keyword on the same line is a parse error.
* `<name>` is the basename of a copybook file; leave the
  extension off. The lookup tries `<name>.cpy`, then
  `<name>.cbl`, then the exact `<name>`, all case-insensitive.
* The trailing period is required.
* Leading whitespace is tolerated, and an `*>` inline comment on
  the same line is fine: `COPY DFHAID. *> 3270 AID bytes`.
* The directive is case-insensitive (`COPY`, `Copy`, `copy` all
  work), and so is the name (`COPY DFHAID.` and `copy dfhaid.`
  resolve to the same file).

### Where bricks searches

The search directory is configured by `copybook_dir=` in
`bricks.cnf`. The default is `runtime/cobolcopy/` (auto-derived
from `runtime_dir` when that line is set). The standard CICS
copybooks ship under this directory, so a fresh install already
has `DFHAID.cpy` and `DFHRESP.cpy` available.

Copybook names are restricted to a flat alphanumeric namespace:
`A-Z`, `a-z`, `0-9`, `-`, `_`, and `.`. Names containing a path
separator, a `..` sequence, or a leading dot are rejected before
any filesystem access. A copybook itself may contain `COPY`
directives; nesting is capped at depth 5 and cycles are detected
explicitly.

### Delivered copybook: DFHAID

`COPY DFHAID.` brings in the standard 3270 attention-identifier
(AID) byte constants. Every AID is declared **twice**, once under
the friendly bricks mnemonic and once under the IBM-traditional
`DFH` alias — both names resolve to the same byte, and a program
may use either style or mix them.

| bricks mnemonic | IBM alias | AID byte | Key |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ENTER` | `DFHENTER` | `X'7D'` | Enter |
| `CLEAR` | `DFHCLEAR` | `X'6D'` | Clear |
| `PA1`   | `DFHPA1`   | `X'6C'` | PA1 |
| `PA2`   | `DFHPA2`   | `X'6E'` | PA2 |
| `PA3`   | `DFHPA3`   | `X'6B'` | PA3 |
| `PF01`  | `DFHPF1`   | `X'F1'` | PF1 |
| `PF02`  | `DFHPF2`   | `X'F2'` | PF2 |
| `PF03`  | `DFHPF3`   | `X'F3'` | PF3 |
| `PF04`  | `DFHPF4`   | `X'F4'` | PF4 |
| `PF05`  | `DFHPF5`   | `X'F5'` | PF5 |
| `PF06`  | `DFHPF6`   | `X'F6'` | PF6 |
| `PF07`  | `DFHPF7`   | `X'F7'` | PF7 |
| `PF08`  | `DFHPF8`   | `X'F8'` | PF8 |
| `PF09`  | `DFHPF9`   | `X'F9'` | PF9 |
| `PF10`  | `DFHPF10`  | `X'7A'` | PF10 |
| `PF11`  | `DFHPF11`  | `X'7B'` | PF11 |
| `PF12`  | `DFHPF12`  | `X'7C'` | PF12 |
| `PF13`  | `DFHPF13`  | `X'C1'` | PF13 |
| `PF14`  | `DFHPF14`  | `X'C2'` | PF14 |
| `PF15`  | `DFHPF15`  | `X'C3'` | PF15 |
| `PF16`  | `DFHPF16`  | `X'C4'` | PF16 |
| `PF17`  | `DFHPF17`  | `X'C5'` | PF17 |
| `PF18`  | `DFHPF18`  | `X'C6'` | PF18 |
| `PF19`  | `DFHPF19`  | `X'C7'` | PF19 |
| `PF20`  | `DFHPF20`  | `X'C8'` | PF20 |
| `PF21`  | `DFHPF21`  | `X'C9'` | PF21 |
| `PF22`  | `DFHPF22`  | `X'4A'` | PF22 |
| `PF23`  | `DFHPF23`  | `X'4B'` | PF23 |
| `PF24`  | `DFHPF24`  | `X'4C'` | PF24 |

The bricks mnemonic uses uniform-width `PF01`..`PF24`; the IBM
alias keeps the no-leading-zero form (`DFHPF1`..`DFHPF24`)
everyone recognises from real CICS code.

### Delivered copybook: DFHRESP

`COPY DFHRESP.` brings in the EXEC CICS condition-code constants
for `EIBRESP`. Each code is declared twice as well — `RESP-X`
mnemonic and `DFHRESP-X` traditional alias. Numeric values match
the runtime's emitter table (`cics/resp.go`), so any code bricks
returns from a verb has a named constant here.

The most useful entries:

| bricks mnemonic | IBM alias | EIBRESP | Condition |
|---|---|---|---|
| `RESP-NORMAL`     | `DFHRESP-NORMAL`     | 0  | success |
| `RESP-ERROR`      | `DFHRESP-ERROR`      | 1  | generic error |
| `RESP-EOC`        | `DFHRESP-EOC`        | 6  | end-of-chain / nothing to RECEIVE |
| `RESP-NOTFND`     | `DFHRESP-NOTFND`     | 13 | record / item / file not found |
| `RESP-DUPREC`     | `DFHRESP-DUPREC`     | 14 | duplicate record on WRITE |
| `RESP-DUPKEY`     | `DFHRESP-DUPKEY`     | 15 | duplicate key in browse |
| `RESP-INVREQ`     | `DFHRESP-INVREQ`     | 16 | invalid request (bad args, sandbox violation) |
| `RESP-IOERR`      | `DFHRESP-IOERR`      | 17 | underlying I/O failure |
| `RESP-NOSPACE`    | `DFHRESP-NOSPACE`    | 18 | TS / TD queue full |
| `RESP-NOTOPEN`    | `DFHRESP-NOTOPEN`    | 19 | file not open / dataset not enabled |
| `RESP-ENDFILE`    | `DFHRESP-ENDFILE`    | 20 | end of browse |
| `RESP-LENGERR`    | `DFHRESP-LENGERR`    | 22 | length mismatch |
| `RESP-QZERO`      | `DFHRESP-QZERO`      | 23 | TS / TD queue empty (READQ TD returns this) |
| `RESP-ITEMERR`    | `DFHRESP-ITEMERR`    | 26 | TS item number out of range |
| `RESP-PGMIDERR`   | `DFHRESP-PGMIDERR`   | 27 | LINK / XCTL program not found |
| `RESP-MAPFAIL`    | `DFHRESP-MAPFAIL`    | 36 | RECEIVE MAP with no input |
| `RESP-INVMPSZ`    | `DFHRESP-INVMPSZ`    | 38 | map size mismatch |
| `RESP-QIDERR`     | `DFHRESP-QIDERR`     | 44 | TS queue id unknown |
| `RESP-ROLLEDBACK` | `DFHRESP-ROLLEDBACK` | 82 | unit-of-work rolled back |

The full list (every code bricks emits) is in
`runtime/cobolcopy/DFHRESP.cpy`. Open the file to see the codes
not summarised above (`RESP-ILLOGIC`, `RESP-SIGNAL`, `RESP-QBUSY`,
the various `RESP-INV...` codes, `RESP-SYSIDERR`, etc.).

### Delivered copybook: SQLCA

`COPY SQLCA.` brings in named constants for `SQLCODE` and the
most common `SQLSTATE` values, so embedded-SQL programs can
write:

```cobol
       COPY SQLCA.
       ...
       EXEC SQL SELECT name INTO :NM
                FROM customers WHERE id = :CUSTID END-EXEC.
       EVALUATE SQLCODE
           WHEN SQL-OK             PERFORM SHOW-ROW
           WHEN SQL-NODATA         PERFORM SHOW-NOT-FOUND
           WHEN SQL-MULTIPLEROWS   PERFORM SHOW-AMBIGUOUS
           WHEN OTHER              PERFORM SHOW-SQL-ERROR
       END-EVALUATE.
```

The SQLCA fields themselves (`SQLCODE`, `SQLSTATE`, `SQLERRMC`)
are auto-injected by the bricks COBOL parser — no `COPY` needed
for the data items. SQLCA only adds the constants programs
compare against.

| bricks mnemonic | IBM alias | SQLCODE | Meaning |
|---|---|---:|---|
| `SQL-OK`            | `DB2-SUCCESS`   | 0     | success |
| `SQL-NODATA`        | `DB2-NOTFOUND`  | +100  | no row / end-of-cursor |
| `SQL-NOTFND`        | `DB2-NOTFOUND`  | +100  | alias |
| `SQL-NOCONFIG`      | —               | -1    | SQL not configured in bricks.cnf |
| `SQL-DDLREJECTED`   | —               | -2    | DDL rejected (CEDA-only) |
| `SQL-GENERIC`       | —               | -100  | generic PG error (see SQLERRMC + log) |
| `SQL-MULTIPLEROWS`  | `DB2-DUPLICATE` | -811  | SELECT INTO returned >1 row |

SQLSTATE constants are PIC X(5) and compare directly:

```cobol
       IF SQLSTATE = SQLSTATE-DUP-KEY THEN
           MOVE 'Already exists.' TO MSG
       END-IF.
```

| Constant | SQLSTATE | Class |
|---|---|---|
| `SQLSTATE-OK`        | `00000` | success |
| `SQLSTATE-NODATA`    | `02000` | no-data |
| `SQLSTATE-WARNING`   | `01000` | warning |
| `SQLSTATE-NOT-NULL`  | `23502` | NOT NULL constraint violated |
| `SQLSTATE-FK-VIOL`   | `23503` | foreign-key constraint violated |
| `SQLSTATE-UQ-VIOL`   | `23505` | UNIQUE constraint violated |
| `SQLSTATE-DUP-KEY`   | `23505` | alias |
| `SQLSTATE-CHK-VIOL`  | `23514` | CHECK constraint violated |
| `SQLSTATE-CONN-FAIL` | `08001` | unable to connect to PG |
| `SQLSTATE-CONN-LOST` | `08006` | connection dropped mid-flight |
| `SQLSTATE-INV-AUTH`  | `28000` | PG authentication failed |
| `SQLSTATE-INV-PWD`   | `28P01` | wrong password |
| `SQLSTATE-SYNTAX`    | `42601` | SQL syntax error |
| `SQLSTATE-UNDEF-TBL` | `42P01` | table doesn't exist |
| `SQLSTATE-UNDEF-COL` | `42703` | column doesn't exist |
| `SQLSTATE-UNDEF-FN`  | `42883` | function doesn't exist |
| `SQLSTATE-AMBIG-COL` | `42702` | ambiguous column reference |
| `SQLSTATE-INSUF-PRIV`| `42501` | permission denied |

The bricks SQL executor also logs every non-zero `SQLCODE`'s full
PG error text via `brickslog.Sys` (one line on the operator
console + the per-run log file). Programs render only the short
mnemonic-driven message on the 3270 screen; the diagnostic detail
lives in the log so PG hostnames / port numbers / wrapper text
don't leak to terminal users.

### Idiom: replacing raw literals

Before — opaque hex and bare integers, easy to mis-key:

```cobol
       IF EIBAID = X'F3' THEN
           MOVE 'Y' TO EXIT-FLAG
       END-IF.
       IF EIBRESP = 13 THEN
           MOVE 'Customer not found.' TO MSG
       END-IF.
       IF EIBRESP = 23 THEN          *> TD queue empty
           MOVE 'Y' TO DONE-FLAG
       END-IF.
```

After — names a reader can scan:

```cobol
       WORKING-STORAGE SECTION.
       COPY DFHAID.
       COPY DFHRESP.
       ...
       IF EIBAID = PF03 THEN          *> or DFHPF3 if you prefer
           MOVE 'Y' TO EXIT-FLAG
       END-IF.
       IF EIBRESP = RESP-NOTFND THEN
           MOVE 'Customer not found.' TO MSG
       END-IF.
       IF EIBRESP = RESP-QZERO THEN
           MOVE 'Y' TO DONE-FLAG
       END-IF.
```

Live examples: `qagc.cob` (PF03 cancel branch), `gusl.cob`
(EVALUATE EIBAID with PF03 / PF07 / PF08 / PF12), `ordr.cob`
(`RESP-QZERO` and `RESP-DUPREC` against READQ TD / WRITE FILE),
`exam.cob` (`RESP-EOC` after RECEIVE). All under
`runtime/cobol/`.

### Restrictions

The bricks COPY preprocessor is deliberately minimal. The
following real-CICS extensions are **not** supported:

* `COPY ... REPLACING ==X== BY ==Y==.` — token substitution.
  Rare in modern code; deferred until a concrete use case
  appears.
* `COPY xyz OF DFHCOB.` / `COPY xyz IN libname.` — library
  qualifier. bricks has one search root per process.
* `COPY xyz SUPPRESS.` — suppress copybook listing. bricks
  produces no listing to suppress.
* Embedded directives: multiple statements on one line including
  a `COPY` are rejected. The line must be `COPY <name>.` and
  nothing else.

If a copybook is edited, programs that include it will pick up
the new contents only after the program's own source mtime
changes (the program cache keys by the program path + mtime,
not the copybook's). A trivial way to force a reload is to
touch the COBOL file:

```
touch runtime/cobol/qagc.cob
```

Or use `CEMT P C` from a TSO/3270 session to flush the entire
program cache.

# Part 6. EXEC SQL command reference

> **Part&nbsp;6 begins here.** The chapter that follows is the
> complete `EXEC SQL` surface — identical for COBOL and REXX. It
> covers every embedded-SQL verb Bricks supports, the SQLCA layout
> and SQLCODE catalogue, the `WHENEVER` declarative error handler,
> cursor lifecycle, per-task `CONNECT TO`, null indicators, and
> SYNCPOINT integration with the bricks unit of work.

## Chapter 26. Embedded SQL (COBOL and REXX)

> **Programming Note.** Although this chapter was originally written
> against COBOL, every `EXEC SQL` shape and behaviour described
> here applies identically to REXX. The REXX-specific notes appear
> later in the chapter under *REXX equivalent*. Programs in either
> language read and write the SQLCA fields (`SQLCODE`, `SQLSTATE`,
> `SQLERRMC`) the same way the COBOL samples do.

bricks accepts the classic IBM-style `EXEC SQL … END-EXEC`
embedded-SQL surface and runs it against the Postgres connection
configured via `db_*` in `bricks.cnf` (see
[SQL support — Phase 1](README.md#sql-support--phase-1-connectivity--ceda-viewer)).
Programs read and write rows through prepared statements; the
SQLCA fields `SQLCODE`, `SQLSTATE`, `SQLERRMC` are auto-injected
into every program's DATA DIVISION so the program can test them
without declaring them.

Scope: single-row CRUD (`SELECT INTO`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`,
`DELETE`, `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`), the four-verb cursor lifecycle
(`DECLARE` / `OPEN` / `FETCH` / `CLOSE`), per-task
`CONNECT TO 'name'` database switching, null indicators
(`:hostvar :indicator`), and the `WHENEVER` declarative
error-handling directive. The same surface works identically in
COBOL and REXX.

### Format

```cobol
       EXEC SQL <statement> END-EXEC.
```

Where `<statement>` is any of the supported verbs (below). Host
variables are written with a leading colon: `:CUSTID`, `:NM`,
`:BALANCE`. The variable name must already exist in DATA DIVISION
— the SQL executor reads its current value (for INPUT bindings)
and writes back (for SELECT INTO targets).

### Supported verbs

| Verb | Notes |
|---|---|
| `SELECT cols INTO :v, :v FROM …` | Single-row read. Returns +100 (no-data) when 0 rows, -811 when >1 row. |
| `INSERT INTO t (…) VALUES (…)` | Host-variable references bound as $N placeholders. |
| `UPDATE t SET … WHERE …` | Returns RESP-NORMAL even when 0 rows match (matches DB2). |
| `DELETE FROM t WHERE …` | Same row-count semantics as UPDATE. |
| `COMMIT WORK` | Commits the per-task PG transaction. Also fired by `EXEC CICS SYNCPOINT`. |
| `ROLLBACK WORK` | Rolls back. Also fired by `EXEC CICS SYNCPOINT ROLLBACK`. |

DDL (`CREATE DATABASE`, `DROP DATABASE`, `CREATE USER`,
`DROP USER`, `ALTER ROLE`, `CREATE TABLESPACE`, …) is **rejected**
with `SQLCODE = -2` and `SQLSTATE = 42501`. CEDA DATABASE owns
those operations and audits each one through `brickslog.Audit`.
`CREATE TABLE` / `ALTER TABLE` / similar non-privileged DDL is
not blocked but is also unsupported in the executor's
statement classification — porters should run schema migrations
with `psql`.

### SQLCODE catalog

bricks adopts the IBM DB2 convention adapted to Postgres. The
catalog below covers what programs typically test:

| SQLCODE | SQLSTATE | Meaning |
|---:|---|---|
| `0`    | `00000` | Success. |
| `+100` | `02000` | No data: SELECT INTO returned 0 rows, or an update/delete affected 0 rows. |
| `-1`   | empty   | No database configured (no `db_*` lines in `bricks.cnf`). |
| `-2`   | `42501` | DDL rejected (CEDA owns CREATE/DROP DATABASE | USER). |
| `-100` | varies  | Generic SQL failure — PG returned an error not specifically mapped. |
| `-811` | `21000` | SELECT INTO returned more than one row. |

`SQLERRMC` always carries the human-readable message from
Postgres (truncated to 70 chars to match the PIC X(70) auto-
injection). When the error path includes a specific SQLSTATE,
that 5-char code lands in `SQLSTATE`; otherwise `SQLSTATE` is
the relevant standard code (`00000` on success, `02000` on
no-data, `HV000` when the failure didn't carry a state).

### SYNCPOINT integration

Each task lazily begins a Postgres transaction on its first
`EXEC SQL` that touches data. The transaction commits when:

* `EXEC CICS SYNCPOINT` runs.
* `EXEC SQL COMMIT WORK` runs.
* The task ends cleanly (RETURN, GOBACK, STOP RUN).

And rolls back when:

* `EXEC CICS SYNCPOINT ROLLBACK` runs.
* `EXEC SQL ROLLBACK WORK` runs.
* The task abends via `EXEC CICS ABEND`.

Postgres-side commit fires *before* the bricks-side bbolt
journal commit. That ordering avoids a hung PG commit leaving
the bricks journal already finalised; failures during the SQL
commit surface as `ROLLEDBACK` from SYNCPOINT, and the bricks
journal then rolls back too.

### Idiomatic test

```cobol
       EXEC SQL
           SELECT name INTO :NM
           FROM customers_sql
           WHERE id = :CUSTID
       END-EXEC.

       EVALUATE SQLCODE
           WHEN RESP-NORMAL   PERFORM SHOW-NAME       *> +0
           WHEN RESP-NOTFND   PERFORM SHOW-NOTFOUND   *> wait -- that's an EIBRESP code; SQLCODE uses RESP-NORMAL/+100/etc.
           WHEN OTHER         PERFORM SHOW-SQL-ERR
       END-EVALUATE.
```

The `RESP-NORMAL` constant (from `COPY DFHRESP`) is value `0`,
the same as the SQLCODE-OK value, so it conveniently doubles as
the success test for both EIBRESP (EXEC CICS) and SQLCODE (EXEC
SQL). For the no-data case, test `SQLCODE = +100` directly —
there's no DFHSQLCODE copybook yet.

### Worked example: SQLD

`runtime/cobol/sqld.cob` (TRANSID `SQLD`) is the bundled
demonstration. It reads a single `customers_sql` row by id and
renders the name + SQLCA verdict on screen `SQLD1`. The
expected schema is documented in the program header. The
operator runs psql once to seed the table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE customers_sql (
    id   text PRIMARY KEY,
    name text NOT NULL
);
INSERT INTO customers_sql VALUES
    ('K001', 'Alice'),
    ('K002', 'Bob'),
    ('K003', 'Carol');
```

Then `bricks` → sign on → `SQLD` → type `K001` → ENTER. The
operator sees `Alice` in the NM cell with SQLCODE = 0 and
SQLSTATE = 00000.

### REXX equivalent

REXX programs use the same `EXEC SQL` shape as COBOL, with `:name`
binding REXX variables. There's no DATA DIVISION analog -- REXX
is dynamically typed -- so SQLCODE, SQLSTATE, SQLERRMC arrive as
ordinary REXX variables the program reads after each statement:

```rexx
ADDRESS CICS

CUSTID = 'K001'
EXEC SQL
    SELECT name INTO :NM
    FROM customers_sql
    WHERE id = :CUSTID
END-EXEC

IF SQLCODE = 0 THEN
    SAY 'Customer:' NM
ELSE IF SQLCODE = 100 THEN
    SAY 'Not found'
ELSE
    SAY 'SQL error' SQLCODE ':' SQLERRMC
```

Behind the scenes the REXX preprocessor (`rexx.PreprocessExecCICS`)
rewrites the EXEC SQL block into a sentinel bare-string that
`runCommand` recognises and routes to the same per-task SQL
executor COBOL uses. The two language surfaces are parity-clean:
the executor doesn't know or care which language drove it. Live
sample: `runtime/rexx/sqlr.rexx`, TRANSID `SQLR`.

**REXX stem-tail gotcha.** Classic REXX resolves `STEM.NAME` by
looking up the simple symbol `NAME` and using its value as the
tail. If a program does `EXEC SQL ... INTO :NM` then writes
`SCR.NM = NM`, the LHS resolves to `SCR.<value-of-NM>` =
`SCR.Alice` — the value lands in the wrong slot. Workaround:
pick a host-var name that is NOT also a stem tail. The bundled
SQLR uses `CUSTNM` instead of `NM` for exactly this reason.

### WHENEVER (declarative error handling)

Instead of testing `SQLCODE` after every statement, a program can
declare a standing rule with `EXEC SQL WHENEVER`:

```cobol
EXEC SQL WHENEVER SQLERROR  GO TO SQL-ERROR-EXIT END-EXEC.
EXEC SQL WHENEVER NOT FOUND GO TO NO-MORE-ROWS  END-EXEC.

EXEC SQL SELECT name INTO :NM FROM customers_sql
         WHERE id = :CUSTID END-EXEC.
*> no SQLCODE test here -- WHENEVER handles it
```

Three conditions, checked after every subsequent `EXEC SQL`:

| Condition | Fires when |
|---|---|
| `SQLERROR` | `SQLCODE` is negative |
| `NOT FOUND` | `SQLCODE` = +100 |
| `SQLWARNING` | `SQLWARN0` = `'W'` (bricks rarely sets this — PG errors rather than warns) |

Each condition takes one of two actions:

* `CONTINUE` — ignore the condition, fall through (the default for
  any condition never declared).
* `GO TO label` / `GOTO label` — branch to the paragraph (COBOL) or
  label (REXX). The branch unwinds any enclosing `PERFORM` exactly
  as an explicit `GO TO` would.

A later `WHENEVER` for the same condition replaces the earlier one
(e.g. declare `GO TO` for a block of statements, then `CONTINUE`
to resume manual handling).

REXX uses the identical syntax; the branch is a `SIGNAL` to the
named label:

```rexx
EXEC SQL WHENEVER SQLERROR GOTO SQLERR END-EXEC
EXEC SQL SELECT name INTO :CUSTNM FROM customers_sql
         WHERE id = :CUSTID END-EXEC
SAY 'customer:' CUSTNM
EXIT
SQLERR:
SAY 'SQL failed, SQLCODE' SQLCODE
EXIT
```

**Scoping caveat.** bricks's `WHENEVER` is *execution-order*
scoped: the directive set by the most recently **executed**
`EXEC SQL WHENEVER` governs later statements. Real DB2 scopes
*lexically* (by source position) because its precompiler inlines
a `SQLCODE` test after every statement. For the dominant pattern
— one `WHENEVER` near the top of the program — the two are
identical. Programs that re-declare `WHENEVER` inside conditional
branches see execution-order semantics; keep WHENEVER declarations
at the top of a paragraph to avoid surprises.

### Cursors (DECLARE / OPEN / FETCH / CLOSE)

Multi-row result sets use the four-verb cursor lifecycle. The
executor parks one `*sql.Rows` per cursor per task; cursors are
closed automatically on `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`, or task end so a
program that forgets `CLOSE` doesn't pin Postgres MVCC.

```cobol
EXEC SQL DECLARE C1 CURSOR FOR
    SELECT id, name FROM customers_sql ORDER BY id
END-EXEC.

EXEC SQL OPEN C1 END-EXEC.

PERFORM UNTIL SQLCODE = 100
    EXEC SQL FETCH C1 INTO :ID, :NM END-EXEC
    IF SQLCODE = 0 THEN
        DISPLAY 'row: ' ID ' ' NM
    END-IF
END-PERFORM.

EXEC SQL CLOSE C1 END-EXEC.
```

REXX uses the same four verbs (the preprocessor routes them all
through the same executor):

```rexx
EXEC SQL DECLARE C1 CURSOR FOR SELECT id, name FROM customers_sql END-EXEC
EXEC SQL OPEN C1 END-EXEC
DO FOREVER
    EXEC SQL FETCH C1 INTO :ID, :CUSTNM END-EXEC
    IF SQLCODE = 100 THEN LEAVE
    SAY 'row:' ID CUSTNM
END
EXEC SQL CLOSE C1 END-EXEC
```

End-of-data is `SQLCODE = +100`. A closed cursor stays in the
registry, so `OPEN c1` can rewind it without re-`DECLARE`.

### Database binding (`transactions.conf` 5th field)

Every transaction starts on exactly one database. Which one is
fixed by the 5th colon-separated field of its row in
`runtime/transactions.conf`:

```
BANK:cobol:bank.cob:public,users,admin:bank
```

The grammar of the file is therefore:

```
transid:lang:program[:groups[:database]]
```

* `database` -- name of a row in `runtime/databases.conf`. The
  match is **case-insensitive**: both sides are folded to lower
  case, the way Postgres folds unquoted identifiers, so `:BANK`
  and `:bank` reach the same database. (They used to be two
  different records opening two pools onto one physical database,
  and a `:BANK` binding against a `bank` row silently failed at
  run time with `SQLCODE = -1`.) Whitespace around the name is
  trimmed, and the name may not contain `:`, a newline or a
  whitespace-preceded ` #` -- `CEDA TRANSACTION` refuses those,
  because they produce a line the parser reads back as a
  different record.
* **Absent 5th field** -- the transaction binds to the **first**
  row of `databases.conf`. The first row is the deployment-wide
  default; CEDA DATABASE labels it `(def)` and refuses `D`elete on
  it.
* **Unknown name** -- the dispatcher logs the misbinding at task
  start and the first `EXEC SQL` returns `SQLCODE = -1` with an
  empty `SQLSTATE`.

A transaction whose program never runs `EXEC SQL` may leave the
field empty -- the implicit default never gets touched. A
transaction whose program **does** run `EXEC SQL` against a
non-default database **must** list the binding explicitly:
omitting it sends every statement to the default pool, which
typically does not host the requested table. The operator-visible
symptom is a flood of paired errors:

```
SQL error SQLCODE=-204 SQLSTATE=42P01: relation "accounts" does not exist
SQL error SQLCODE=-100 SQLSTATE=25P02: current transaction is aborted, commands ignored until end of transaction block
```

The `-204` is the first statement landing on the wrong pool; the
`-100 / 25P02` cascade is Postgres marking the per-task PG
transaction aborted, so every follow-up statement under a
`WHENEVER SQLERROR CONTINUE` declaration logs the same pair until
SYNCPOINT runs at task end. Fix: add the correct 5th field and
restart the task.

`CEDA TRANSACTION` (A / U actions) and operator-`vi` edits of
`transactions.conf` both honour the field; the file is hot-
reloaded on mtime change.

### CONNECT TO 'name' (per-task database switch)

A program that needs to touch a second database during a task
issues `EXEC SQL CONNECT TO 'name'`. The named database must
exist in `databases.conf` (the CEDA DATABASE catalogue); an
unknown name returns `SQLCODE = -1`. The name is matched
case-insensitively — it is folded to lower case, like every other
database-name path in bricks — so `CONNECT TO 'ORDERS'` finds the
`orders` row. An in-flight PG transaction
on the previous database is committed implicitly (matches DB2's
behaviour) -- programs that want to discard the previous work
should `EXEC SQL ROLLBACK` before connecting.

```cobol
EXEC SQL CONNECT TO 'orders' END-EXEC.
EXEC SQL INSERT INTO order_lines VALUES (:ID, :QTY) END-EXEC.
EXEC SQL COMMIT END-EXEC.
EXEC SQL CONNECT TO 'customers' END-EXEC.
EXEC SQL SELECT email INTO :EM FROM customers WHERE id = :CID END-EXEC.
```

Implicit binding still applies to the first statement of every
task -- the transaction's `Database` column in `transactions.conf`
picks the starting pool. `CONNECT TO` is only needed when the
program needs to move between databases inside a single task.

### Null indicators (`:hostvar :indicator`)

DB2 programs use a second host var beside the value to signal
NULL. Bricks supports the same pair syntax in both COBOL and
REXX:

```cobol
EXEC SQL
    SELECT name INTO :NM :NIND
    FROM customers_sql WHERE id = :CUSTID
END-EXEC.

EVALUATE NIND
    WHEN 0   DISPLAY 'Name: ' NM
    WHEN -1  DISPLAY 'Name is NULL'
END-EVALUATE.
```

Output side (SELECT INTO / FETCH INTO):

* Column was non-NULL → indicator = `0`, value holds the result.
* Column was NULL → indicator = `-1`, value is cleared to the empty
  string so a program that ignored its indicator can't read a
  stale value from a previous statement.

Input side (WHERE / VALUES / SET clauses):

```cobol
MOVE -1 TO NIND.
EXEC SQL
    INSERT INTO customers_sql (id, name) VALUES (:K, :NM :NIND)
END-EXEC.
```

* Indicator = `-1` at bind time → bricks passes NULL to PG,
  regardless of what `NM` currently holds.
* Indicator = `0` (or unset) → the value var's frame contents
  bind normally.

Pair detection: a value/indicator pair is two `:name` tokens
separated only by whitespace. `:NM, :NIND` (with a comma) means
two independent host vars, not a pair. The `INDICATOR` keyword
form (`:NM INDICATOR :NIND`) is not currently supported -- use the
juxtaposed form.

### Column-value coercion

PG's wire format doesn't always match what COBOL or REXX want to
read. Bricks normalises three cases before the value reaches the
program's host variable:

* **`bool` columns** -- PG returns `"t"` / `"f"` (or `"true"` /
  `"false"`). Bricks converts to `"1"` / `"0"` so COBOL PIC X(1)
  flags and REXX `IF VAR = 1` idioms work the way they do in DB2.
* **`NUMERIC(p, s)` columns** -- PG drops trailing fractional
  zeros for computed expressions (`SELECT 1.5` returns `"1.5"`
  even though the result type has scale 2). Bricks pads the
  value to the column's declared scale, so a COBOL `PIC 9(3)V99`
  target receives `"1.50"` → digits `"150"` → stored as `001.50`,
  not `000.15`.
* **`CHAR(N)` columns** -- PG returns space-padded values. Bricks
  trims trailing spaces so a REXX literal compare (`IF VAR = 'X'`)
  doesn't fail because the CHAR(5) value was `"X    "`. VARCHAR
  is left alone (PG never pads it; its trailing spaces are real).

Other types (INT, BIGINT, TEXT, DATE, TIMESTAMP, JSON, …) flow
through verbatim. COBOL's MOVE semantics handle integer sign and
zero-pad automatically; REXX is dynamically typed so the string
form works for both display and arithmetic.

### Restrictions

| Out of scope | Why |
|---|---|
| Stored procedure calls (`EXEC SQL CALL`) | Out of scope — porters use plain SELECT-from-function. |
| Multi-row INSERT VALUES (…), (…) | Out of scope; rewrite as one statement per row. |
| `CREATE` / `DROP DATABASE | USER` | CEDA DATABASE only (C / X actions, audit-logged). |
| Long-running cursors across `EXEC CICS RETURN` chains | Out of scope; each task gets a fresh PG connection. |

## Chapter 27. Restrictions and deferred features

This chapter is the canonical list of language features bricks
does **not** accept. Anything not listed here can be assumed
implemented; refer back to the relevant Chapter 14–26 section
for the supported syntax.

### COBOL — disallowed at parse time

* **Calculated GOTOs.** `GO TO ... DEPENDING ON expr` is
  rejected. Every task has its own heap and stack with no
  static control-block aliasing; supporting calculated GOTOs
  would require a per-program label-table the parser
  deliberately doesn't build.
* **Nested `OCCURS`.** An array of arrays is rejected at parse
  time. One level of `OCCURS` is fine.
* **`EVALUATE TRUE` / `EVALUATE FALSE`.** The conditional /
  computed form is rejected with a hint to rewrite as
  `IF/ELSE`. The simple-value form is supported.

### COBOL — deferred (would be implementable, not yet wired)

| Area | Specifics |
|---|---|
| DATA DIVISION | `USAGE COMP-1` (single float), `USAGE COMP-2` (double float), `SYNC`, `INDEXED BY`, `OCCURS DEPENDING ON`, `66` / `78` levels, `BLANK WHEN ZERO`, and IBM's extension allowing a level-01 redefiner *larger* than its target (bricks requires the redefining item to fit at every level). `USAGE COMP` / `COMP-4` / `COMPUTATIONAL` / `BINARY`, `USAGE COMP-3` / `COMPUTATIONAL-3` / `PACKED-DECIMAL`, and `REDEFINES` ARE supported — see Chapter 21. |
| Edited PIC | Edit characters `+`, `-`, `CR`, `DB`, `B`, `0`, `/`. (`Z`, `.`, `,`, `$`, `*` are supported.) |
| PROCEDURE DIVISION | `CALL` (external program), `SEARCH` / `SEARCH ALL`, `ALTER`, `INITIALIZE`, `ACCEPT`, `EXIT PARAGRAPH` / `EXIT SECTION`, `GO TO ... DEPENDING ON`, `DIVIDE … REMAINDER`. In-line `PERFORM ... END-PERFORM`, `PERFORM ... THRU`, `WITH TEST BEFORE/AFTER`, `VARYING ... AFTER` and `EXIT PERFORM [CYCLE]` ARE supported — see [Chapter 22](#chapter-22-procedure-division). |
| Reference modification | Two forms are rejected at parse time: a slice on an `OF` / `IN` qualifier (`K(1:2) OF ROW`), and a subscript combined with a slice in one reference (`TBL(idx)(start:length)`). Slice the whole reference, or `MOVE` the OCCURS slot to a work field first. Plain `identifier(start:length)` on either side of a statement IS supported — see [Chapter 22](#chapter-22-procedure-division). |
| Intrinsic functions | Only `UPPER-CASE`, `LOWER-CASE`, `LENGTH`, `NUMVAL`, `TRIM`, `REVERSE`, `POS` are implemented. The statistical / date / time families are not. `FUNCTION TRIM` does NOT accept the `LEADING` / `TRAILING` modifier. |
| Copybooks | `COPY ... REPLACING ==X== BY ==Y==.`, library qualifiers (`COPY name OF lib`), `SUPPRESS`. |
| EXEC SQL | Multi-row `INSERT VALUES (...), (...)`. Stored-procedure calls (`EXEC SQL CALL`). DDL inside the executor — use `psql` or CEDA DATABASE. |
| EXEC CICS | `SCREENHT`-based map family suffix (e.g. `CUST1L` on a mod-4 screen) is REXX-only; COBOL twins always render the unsuffixed mod-2 map. |

### REXX — deferred / accepted but inert

| Area | Specifics |
|---|---|
| Tracing | `TRACE` is parsed but emits no trace output. |
| Settings | `OPTIONS …` parsed and accepted; recognised options are none. `NUMERIC FORM SCIENTIFIC` / `ENGINEERING` accepted syntactically, rendering is always plain decimal. |
| External routines | No dynamic linking — every callable is either a `PROCEDURE` in the program or a built-in. |
| Address environments | Only `ADDRESS CICS` is wired for host-command dispatch. `ADDRESS COMMAND` / `ADDRESS SYSTEM` / `ADDRESS TSO` do parse, and `ADDRESS()` reports whichever name is current, but the first host command issued under one fails with `ADDRESS handler not registered`. |
| Terminal queue | `PUSH`, `QUEUE`, `PULL`, `PARSE PULL` are parsed; the queue is always empty. Use `EXEC CICS RECEIVE` for terminal input. |
| PARSE | `PARSE SOURCE`, `PARSE VERSION`, `PARSE NUMERIC` are not wired. `PARSE LOWER` is not parsed (only `UPPER`). |
| Conditions | `FAILURE`, `NOTREADY`, `LOSTDIGITS` are not implemented. `HALT` parses but never fires (bricks has no external-halt fan-in). |
| Numeric | Arithmetic is float64 internally, then rounded to `NUMERIC DIGITS` significant figures — strict IEEE behaviour is not preserved. |
| Built-ins | `ERRORTEXT(code)` echoes the code rather than returning the standard REXX error-text string. |
| Variables / `DROP` | Two divergences, both visible through `SYMBOL()`. First, `DROP A.J` does not derive the tail: the DROP parser consumes a single identifier and `.` is an ordinary symbol character, so the literal tail `J` is dropped where TRL2 drops `A.3` — clear the slot with `A.J = ''` if you need the derived name. Second, after `S. = 'd'` a `DROP S.1` removes the tail but leaves the stem default in force, so `S.1` reads back as `d` and `SYMBOL('S.1')` answers `VAR` where TRL2 answers `LIT`. |

### COBOL

| Transid | File | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `HELC` | `runtime/cobol/hello.cob` | Hello-world; `SEND MAP('HELO1') FROM(SCR)`, `RETURN`. Smallest end-to-end demo. |
| `QAGC` | `runtime/cobol/qagc.cob` | COBOL twin of `QAGR` (REXX). Validates the QAGE1 birthdate, computes age in years and approximate days, sends QAGR1. Pseudo-conversational redisplay of QAGE1 on validation errors. |
| `GUST` | `runtime/cobol/gust.cob` | COBOL `CUST`. A=Add, Q=Query, U=Update, D=Delete, L=List, S=Search; the S action LINKs to GUSL with the search term in COMMAREA and renders the match count returned. |
| `GUSV` | `runtime/cobol/gusv.cob` | COBOL twin of `CUSV`. Validates the customer-number COMMAREA (LINK target). |
| `GUSL` | `runtime/cobol/gusl.cob` | COBOL twin of `CUSL`. Renders the customers file via STARTBR / READNEXT / ENDBR. Blank inbound COMMAREA = paginated all-records list (PF7/PF8). Non-blank inbound COMMAREA = filtered single-page browse: every record is `FUNCTION POS`-tested against the upper-cased filter, the first 15 matches populate ROW1..ROW15, and the total match count flows back through DFHCOMMAREA so the caller (GUST) can render a summary. |
| `EXAM` | `runtime/cobol/exam.cob` | Worked example of reading the operator's command-line arguments. Type `EXAM 1 2 3` at the blank prompt. |
| `ORDR` | `runtime/cobol/ordr.cob` | Conversational import: reads `runtime/tmp/orders.sample.txt` via `READQ TD`, parses pipe-delimited rows, and `WRITE FILE('ORDERS')` keyed on customer-id. Tolerates duplicates (`EIBRESP = RESP-DUPREC`). Summary screen shows counts. See [worked example E](#e-sequential-import-via-readq-td--write-file). |
| `TIMC` | `runtime/cobol/timc.cob` | Timed-reminder demo: exercises `CONVERSE`, `START` (with `INTERVAL` + `FROM`), and `RETRIEVE` end-to-end. Shares `tim1.map` + `tim2.map` with `TIMR`. |
| `SQLD` | `runtime/cobol/sqld.cob` | Embedded-SQL demo: `EXEC SQL SELECT name INTO :NM FROM customers_sql WHERE id = :CUSTID`. Renders the row + SQLCODE / SQLSTATE / SQLERRMC. Requires Postgres seeded with the schema shown in [Chapter 26](#chapter-26-embedded-sql-cobol). |
| `SQLR` | `runtime/rexx/sqlr.rexx` | REXX twin of `SQLD`. Shares the `customers_sql` table; demonstrates how REXX accesses the same EXEC SQL surface (SQLCODE / SQLSTATE / SQLERRMC arrive as plain REXX variables). |
| `GMPT` | `runtime/cobol/gmpt.cob` | COBOL pointer / storage demo: `EXEC CICS GETMAIN SET(WS-PTR) FLENGTH(16)`, `SET ADDRESS OF` a based LINKAGE 01 onto the buffer, write-and-read through it, then `EXEC CICS ADDRESS COMMAREA` / `ADDRESS EIB`. Result painted with `SEND TEXT` (no map). See [`GETMAIN`/`FREEMAIN`](#getmain--freemain--exec-cics-getmain-exec-cics-freemain) and the [COBOL pointer model](#cobol-pointer-model-usage-pointer--set-address-of). |

All five non-trivial COBOL samples (`QAGC`, `GUST`, `GUSL`,
`ORDR`, `EXAM`) `COPY DFHAID` and/or `COPY DFHRESP` instead of
hard-coding hex AID bytes or numeric `EIBRESP` codes. Skim any
of them as living examples of the named-constant idiom from
[Chapter 25](#chapter-25-copybooks).


### REXX (selected)

| Transid | File | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `HELO` | `runtime/rexx/hello.rexx` | Hello-world with system-info pane on mod 4. |
| `CUST` | `runtime/rexx/cust.rexx` | Full customer maintenance — Add / Query / Update / Delete / List / Search; LINKs to `CUSV` for validation. |
| `CUSV` | `runtime/rexx/cusv.rexx` | Validation sub-program; called by `CUST` via `EXEC CICS LINK`. |
| `CUSL` | `runtime/rexx/cusl.rexx` | Paginated customer list using `STARTBR / READNEXT / ENDBR`; adapts paging to mod 2 vs mod 4. |
| `QAGE` / `QAGR` | `runtime/rexx/qage.rexx` / `qagr.rexx` | Pseudo-conversational chain; `QAGE` prompts for a birthdate and chains to `QAGR` to render the result. |
| `PROD` / `CONS` | `runtime/rexx/prod.rexx` / `cons.rexx` | TS queue producer / consumer pair. Conversational; PF3 to exit. |
| `GETC` | `runtime/rexx/getc.rexx` | `RECEIVE` of command-line + `READ FILE` + `SEND TEXT` (no map). |
| `INQR` | `runtime/rexx/inqr.rexx` | `EXEC CICS INQUIRE` demo: direct `INQUIRE TASK` on this task plus a `STARTBROWSE FILE` / `INQUIRE FILE NEXT` / `ENDBROWSE` loop listing every file's OPEN/ENABLE status and record/key sizes. Result painted with `SEND TEXT` (no map). See [INQUIRE / SET resources](#inquire--set-resources--file-task-transaction-terminal-program). |
| `TIMR` | `runtime/rexx/timr.rexx` | REXX twin of `TIMC`: `START` schedules a reminder; `RETRIEVE` discriminates cold vs scheduled entry. Shares `tim1.map` + `tim2.map` with `TIMC`. |
| `SCHD` | `runtime/rexx/schd.rexx` | Demonstrates three features in one transaction: `START ... AFTER SECONDS(n)`, `ADDRESS()` and `SYMBOL()`. Paints one PASS/FAIL row per check, then schedules itself with `AFTER SECONDS(10)`; the timer-fire path reports the payload and issues no further `START`, so the chain ends on its own. Contrast the plain `AFTER SECONDS(...)` here with the manual `HH`/`MM`/`SS` packing `TIMR` needs for `INTERVAL(hhmmss)`. |
| `CHAT` | `runtime/rexx/chat.rexx` | Real-time multi-user chat. Self-refreshes every 2 seconds via `EXEC CICS START TRANSID('CHAT') INTERVAL(000002)`; the tick handler does `SEND MAP ... DATAONLY` so the operator's in-progress typing at the bottom of the screen is **not** clobbered by the refresh. Messages persist in the auto-created KSDS file `CHATLOG` (one record per message, key shape `YYYYMMDDHHMMSS-NNNN-TTTT` for lexicographic / chronological sort). Adapts between Model 2 (16 history rows, `chatm2.map`) and Model 4 (35 history rows, `chatm4.map`) via `EXEC CICS ASSIGN SCREENHT`. F3 exits cleanly — no further tick is scheduled, the self-refresh chain dies on its own. Colours mirror the original `tsu/chat.go` palette: BLUE/BRIGHT title, TURQUOISE clock + footer, YELLOW topic, RED status line, GREEN history rows + prompt, WHITE underscored input. |

Run any TRANSID by typing it at the blank prompt after CSSN sign-on.
Refer to `runtime/transactions.conf` for the full list and ACL
configuration.

### Built-in transactions (no entry in `transactions.conf`)

The bricks core dispatches a handful of TRANSIDs directly, without
consulting `transactions.conf`. They take precedence over a same-name
entry in the table.

| Transid | Purpose | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `CSSN` | Sign-on | Default authentication flow. Configurable via `secure_login_transacton` in `bricks.cnf`. |
| `CSSF` | Sign-off | `CSSF LOGOFF` clears the session's identity; bare `CSSF` is a no-op. |
| `CEMT` | Master-operator | INQUIRE / MONITOR / PERFORM trees; CONTROLBLOCKS sub-tree and PERFORM gated on the `admin` group. |
| `CEDA` | Resource definitions | TRANSACTION / PROGRAM / USER screens; admin-only. |
| `CECI` | Command-level interpreter | Type one `EXEC CICS` / `EXEC SQL` / `EXEC WEB` command (up to 5 input rows), press `PF5`, see RESPONSE / RESP2 / LEN / ELAPSED plus any variables the handler set or `INTO` buffers it filled. The `TxCB` and `cics.Handler` are session-scoped — built once on CECI entry, torn down on `PF3` / `CLEAR` / `PA1` / disconnect. Each `PF5` press is a per-PF5 commit boundary via `h.CommitImplicit()` on success / `h.RollbackImplicit()` on failure; SYNCPOINT in bricks does not touch cursors, so the per-task TS read cursor, all open browses, TD handles, WEB sessions, and DOCUMENT tokens survive across PF5 presses (a `STARTBR` on PF5 #1 drives `READNEXT` on PF5 #2). Variable frame is also session-scoped. `READ UPDATE` + `REWRITE` still cannot span PF5 — the per-PF5 implicit SYNCPOINT releases non-`HOLD` record locks; see the [`REWRITE` deviation note](#rewrite) for the recommended workaround. Verbs that would unwind the CECI task itself (`RETURN`, `XCTL`, `LINK`, `ABEND`), repaint the screen (`SEND MAP`, `SEND TEXT`, `RECEIVE MAP`, `CONVERSE`), schedule deferred work (`START`, `RETRIEVE`, `CANCEL`, `DELAY`), or set per-task trap tables (`HANDLE`, `IGNORE`, `WHENEVER`) are refused with a short red-status message. Every command is wrapped in a 7-second wall-clock cap; a cap-hit *poisons* the session (every subsequent PF5 short-circuits with `TIMEOUT`, and the session-end defer skips the handler-owned closers to avoid racing the abandoned goroutine — `PF3` is the only exit). Gated on the `dev` group — and the same gate applies to `EXEC CICS LINK PROGRAM('CECI')` / `XCTL PROGRAM('CECI')`, so a non-DEV caller sees `PGMIDERR` (LINK) or a 403 task-error screen (XCTL) without the built-in's own Run ever being reached. **Operator manual:** the [CECI section in `README.md`](README.md#ceci--command-level-interpreter) covers layout, key bindings, verb policy, the response-line state mapping, and the EBCDIC-037 input rules. |
| `ISPF` | Source editor | Browse and edit the REXX, COBOL, and BMS-map source trees. Gated on the `dev` group. **Operator manual:** [`ISPF_editor.md`](ISPF_editor.md) — covers every PF key, every command-line word, every line-prefix command (D / I / C / M / R / U / L / ) / ( / X / O / A / B plus the doubled block forms), the file browser, the warn-then-save flow, multi-file editing, and edit locks. |

Every built-in TRANSID above can be reached via `EXEC CICS LINK
PROGRAM(name)` and `EXEC CICS XCTL PROGRAM(name)` as well as by
typing it at the blank prompt. The two paths share one dispatch
helper, so the per-built-in auth gate (`dev` for ISPF/CECI,
`admin` for CEDA/IDCA) fires uniformly regardless of how the
operator reached it. CEMT carries a mixed model — the outer menu
is open to any signed-on user (INQUIRE TRANSACTION, MONITOR), and
the `CONTROLBLOCKS` / `PERFORM` sub-trees gate on `admin` inside
`walk()`. The ACL check at the LINK / XCTL boundary refuses a
denied caller before the built-in's `Run` is reached: the LINK
returns the access-denied error to `programControl` which
surfaces `PGMIDERR` via `EIBRESP`, and the XCTL renders the
familiar 403 task-error screen — no internal refusal paint
hijacks the caller's session. Built-ins do not have a
COMMAREA-style interface; `LINK PROGRAM('CEMT') COMMAREA(VAR)`
returns an empty COMMAREA (`VAR` is set to "" on return) and the
caller's `sess.Commarea` is restored unchanged. `CSSN` is the one
exception: it refuses LINK/XCTL with a short message because the
auth-prompt loop cannot be wedged into a caller's task stack
sanely; operators sign on at a blank prompt.

## Chapter 29. Worked examples

### A. Producer / consumer over a TS queue

`PROD` writes one item per ENTER from an interactive map; `CONS`
reads with the implicit per-task cursor. PF4 in `CONS` deletes the
queue; PF5 rewinds the cursor by chaining back to itself
(`RETURN TRANSID('CONS')`), so the dispatcher's task-end hook clears
the cursor.

```rexx
/* PROD: write one item per ENTER */
ADDRESS CICS
DO FOREVER
  EXEC CICS SEND    MAP('PROD1') FROM(SCR.) ERASE END-EXEC
  EXEC CICS RECEIVE MAP('PROD1')                  END-EXEC
  IF C2X(EIBAID) = 'F3' THEN EXEC CICS RETURN END-EXEC
  EXEC CICS WRITEQ TS QUEUE(MAP.QNAME) FROM(MAP.PAYLOAD) END-EXEC
END
```

```rexx
/* CONS: cursor-advancing read */
ADDRESS CICS
DO FOREVER
  EXEC CICS SEND    MAP('CONS1') FROM(SCR.) ERASE END-EXEC
  EXEC CICS RECEIVE MAP('CONS1')                  END-EXEC
  IF C2X(EIBAID) = 'F3' THEN EXEC CICS RETURN END-EXEC
  EXEC CICS READQ TS QUEUE(QNM) INTO(REC) ITEM(GOTI) END-EXEC
  IF EIBRESP = 26 THEN /* ITEMERR — end of queue */ NOP
END
```

### B. SEND TEXT + RECEIVE — no BMS map

`GETC` takes a customer number from the operator's command line
(`GETC 100`), reads the `customers` KSDS, and paints the record as
free-form text. Because **3270 has no LF**, the body is built as a
flat row-major buffer — each logical line padded to the 80-column
screen width with `LEFT(s,80)`.

```rexx
/* GETC: lookup-and-display, no map */
ADDRESS CICS
EXEC CICS RECEIVE INTO(BUF) END-EXEC          /* "GETC 100" */
PARSE VAR BUF TID CKEY .
EXEC CICS READ FILE('customers') INTO(REC) RIDFLD(CKEY) END-EXEC
PARSE VAR REC NM '|' AD '|' CY '|' PH
TXT = LEFT('Customer #' || CKEY, 80)          /* row 0 */
TXT = TXT || LEFT('', 80)                     /* row 1 (blank) */
TXT = TXT || LEFT('Name:    ' || NM, 80)      /* row 2 */
TXT = TXT || LEFT('Address: ' || AD, 80)      /* row 3 */
EXEC CICS SEND TEXT FROM(TXT) ERASE END-EXEC
EXEC CICS RETURN END-EXEC
```

The COBOL companion `runtime/cobol/exam.cob` shows the same
`RECEIVE INTO` pattern with `UNSTRING ... DELIMITED BY ' '` doing
the tokenisation:

```cobol
EXEC CICS RECEIVE INTO(WS-INPUT) LENGTH(WS-LEN) END-EXEC
UNSTRING WS-INPUT DELIMITED BY ' '
   INTO WS-TID WS-A WS-B WS-C
END-UNSTRING.
```

### C. Browse with GENERIC prefix

A paginated customer list filtered by a 3-character key prefix:

```rexx
EXEC CICS STARTBR FILE('CUSTOMERS')
                 RIDFLD('NY-')
                 GENERIC KEYLENGTH(3)
END-EXEC
DO FOREVER
  EXEC CICS READNEXT FILE('CUSTOMERS') INTO(REC) RIDFLD(K) END-EXEC
  IF EIBRESP = 20 THEN LEAVE          /* ENDFILE */
  CALL ADD_ROW K, REC
END
EXEC CICS ENDBR FILE('CUSTOMERS') END-EXEC
```

### D. Synchronous LINK with COMMAREA

`CUST` LINKs to `CUSV` to validate a customer number:

```rexx
SAV = CKEY                                       /* in: number to validate */
EXEC CICS LINK PROGRAM('CUSV') COMMAREA(SAV) END-EXEC
PARSE VAR SAV STATUS '|' MSG                     /* out: status, message  */
IF STATUS <> 'OK' THEN ...
```

`CUSV` reads `DFHCOMMAREA`, runs its check, and writes the result
back into `DFHCOMMAREA` before `RETURN`. The dispatcher hands the
final value back to the caller's `SAV`.

### E. Sequential import via READQ TD + WRITE FILE

The `ORDR` transaction (`runtime/cobol/ordr.cob`) demonstrates the
"text file → VSAM" pattern that the `tmp_dir` sandbox is built for.
The sample data ships in `runtime/tmp/orders.sample.txt`:

```
C0000001|WIDGET-A|10|19.95
C0000002|WIDGET-B|2|249.00
...
```

The loop body is just two EXEC CICS calls and an `UNSTRING`:

```cobol
IMPORT-ONE.
    MOVE SPACES TO REC.
    EXEC CICS READQ TD QUEUE('orders.sample.txt') INTO(REC) END-EXEC.
    IF EIBRESP = 12 THEN
        MOVE 'Y' TO DONE-FLAG       *> QZERO -- end of file
    END-IF.
    IF EIBRESP = 0 THEN
        COMPUTE N-READ = N-READ + 1
        MOVE SPACES TO CUST-ID PRODUCT QTY PRICE
        UNSTRING REC DELIMITED BY '|'
            INTO CUST-ID PRODUCT QTY PRICE
        END-UNSTRING
        PERFORM WRITE-ORDER
    END-IF.

WRITE-ORDER.
    MOVE SPACES TO OREC.
    STRING PRODUCT DELIMITED BY SIZE
           '|' DELIMITED BY SIZE
           QTY DELIMITED BY SIZE
           '|' DELIMITED BY SIZE
           PRICE DELIMITED BY SIZE
        INTO OREC
    END-STRING.
    EXEC CICS WRITE FILE('ORDERS') FROM(OREC) RIDFLD(CUST-ID) END-EXEC.
    IF EIBRESP = 0  THEN COMPUTE N-WRITE = N-WRITE + 1 END-IF.
    IF EIBRESP = 14 THEN COMPUTE N-DUP   = N-DUP   + 1 END-IF.
```

Notes:

* The READQ loop tracks EOF with `EIBRESP = 12` (`QZERO`) — the
  CICS-canonical "queue empty / no more records" signal. The
  handle is closed automatically at task end.
* `EIBRESP = 14` (`DUPREC`) is treated as a counted no-op, not an
  error: `WRITE FILE` against an existing key fails atomically
  without overwriting, so a re-run of `ORDR` on the same file is
  idempotent on the customer-id set.
* `ORDR` ships `public` in `runtime/transactions.conf` so the
  sample runs out of the box. In a production deployment that
  imports real data, restrict it to a privileged group
  (`ORDR:cobol:ordr.cob:admin`) so a casual operator can't replay
  the import.
* A REXX equivalent reads the same file via `LINEIN` and writes via
  `EXEC CICS WRITE`. Because both languages share the `tmp_dir`
  backend, the sample file works untouched from either side.

### F. Menu items gated by `QUERY SECURITY`

The shipped `GUST` transaction (`runtime/cobol/gust.cob`) is a
small CRUD UI: A=Add / Q=Query / U=Update / D=Delete / L=List /
S=Search. Delete is destructive and only the admin role should be
allowed to invoke it. Before 2.7.x the operator had to hard-code
`IF EIBUSER = 'ADMIN'` or `IF EIBTRMID = ...`, which bypasses the
ACL gate that already governs sign-on. `QUERY SECURITY` lets the
program ask the dispatcher's `SecurityChecker` directly:

```cobol
       WORKING-STORAGE SECTION.
       COPY DFHAID.
       COPY DFHRESP.
       COPY DFHVALUE.
       ...
       01 WS-CACR-UP PIC S9(8) VALUE 0.
       ...
       DISPATCH.
           ...
      *> EXEC CICS QUERY SECURITY: refuse D=Delete to callers who
      *> are not authorised to UPDATE the GUST resource.
           IF VALID-ACTION = 'Y' AND ACTION = 'D' THEN
               EXEC CICS QUERY SECURITY RESOURCE('GUST')
                                        UPDATE(WS-CACR-UP) END-EXEC
               IF WS-CACR-UP NOT = DFHVALUE-UPDATABLE THEN
                   MOVE 'Delete not permitted for this user.' TO MSG
                   MOVE 'N' TO VALID-ACTION
               END-IF
           END-IF.
```

The gate runs once per dispatch (the verb is stateless and cheap)
and lands before the `EVALUATE ACTION` switch. Non-admins see the
`MSG` line on the next menu paint; admins fall through to
`ACT-DELETE` unchanged. The same pattern transports to any
program with a destructive action — replace `'GUST'` with the
gated transaction's TRANSID and reuse the four-line block.

See the in-tree `runtime/cobolcopy/DFHVALUE.cpy` for the full
constant set, and the security-inquiry sub-chapter of
[Chapter 6](#chapter-6-system-services) for the bricks-flavoured
access mapping that decides the `WS-CACR-UP` value.

# Appendix A. Adapting to terminal size (mod 2 vs mod 4)

A 3270 connection negotiates one of several screen models —
typically mod 2 (24 - 80) or mod 4 (43 - 80). Bricks captures the
size from the telnet/3270 handshake into `session.TCB.Rows/Cols`,
and exposes it to programs via `EXEC CICS ASSIGN`:

```rexx
EXEC CICS ASSIGN SCREENHT(SCRH) SCREENWD(SCRW)
                 ALTSCRNHT(AH)  ALTSCRNWD(AW)  END-EXEC
```

`SEND MAP` always passes the negotiated `DevInfo` through to
`go3270.ScreenOpts.AltScreen`, so the underlying datastream uses
Erase/Write Alternate (`0x7e`) and the terminal clears its full
buffer — but a 24-row map painted on a 43-row screen leaves rows
24-42 blank. To use the extra real estate the program has to
dispatch to a sized map variant.

### Convention

Author one map per model. The mod-2 map keeps its bare name; bigger
models add a single-letter suffix:

| Model | Suffix | Example map names                |
|-------|--------|----------------------------------|
| mod 2 | (none) | `HELO1`, `CUST1`, `CUST2`, `CUSTL` |
| mod 3 | `M`    | `HELO1M`, `CUST1M`, …            |
| mod 4 | `L`    | `HELO1L`, `CUST1L`, `CUST2L`, `CUSTLL` |
| mod 5 | `W`    | `HELO1W`, …                      |

The REXX program builds the suffixed name once and dispatches:

```rexx
EXEC CICS ASSIGN SCREENHT(SCRH) END-EXEC
SUFFIX = ''
IF SCRH >= 43 THEN SUFFIX = 'L'
ELSE IF SCRH >= 32 THEN SUFFIX = 'M'

EXEC CICS SEND MAP('HELO1' || SUFFIX) FROM(SCR.) ERASE END-EXEC
IF EIBRESP = 36 THEN DO            /* MAPFAIL — sized variant missing */
  EXEC CICS SEND MAP('HELO1') FROM(SCR.) ERASE END-EXEC
END
```

Three properties make this work without any DSL changes:

1. **Same field names across the family.** `helo1.map` and
   `helo1l.map` both declare `INFOLINE`, `GREETING`, `FOOTER`. The
   same `SCR.` stem feeds either one. Bonus tails (e.g.
   `INFO1` / `INFO2` / `ACT1` …) are silently ignored on the
   smaller map (the renderer only writes values for fields that
   the map declares).
2. **MAPFAIL fallback.** If the suffixed map isn't on disk, the
   `SEND` returns `EIBRESP = 36` and the program retries with the
   bare name — so an operator who deletes `helo1l.map` doesn't
   break mod-4 connections; they just see the 24-80 layout.
3. **Paging arithmetic adapts at runtime.** `cusl.rexx` reads
   `SCREENHT` and uses `ROWS_PER_PAGE = 35` on mod 4 vs `15` on
   mod 2, then picks `CUSTLL` vs `CUSTL` accordingly.

Bricks ships sized variants for every map the demo transactions
use:

| Mod-2 map (24-80) | Mod-4 sibling (43-80) |
|-------------------|------------------------|
| `runtime/map/helo1.map` | `runtime/map/helo1l.map` — adds system-information + recent-activity panes |
| `runtime/map/cust1.map` (menu) | `runtime/map/cust1l.map` — adds recent-activity history |
| `runtime/map/cust2.map` (detail) | `runtime/map/cust2l.map` — adds an audit-log pane |
| `runtime/map/custl.map` (15-row list) | `runtime/map/custll.map` (35-row list) |

To see the difference: connect with `c3270 -model 2 localhost 2300`
vs. `c3270 -model 4 localhost 2300`, sign on, and run `HELO` or
`CUST`. The mod-4 view fills the bottom three-quarters of the
screen with extra panels.

# Appendix B. Pitfalls and idioms

### REXX compound-symbol pitfall

`STEM.tail` with `tail` an *unset* symbol resolves to `STEM.<TAIL>`
(a literal tail). With `tail` a *set* symbol it resolves to
`STEM.<value-of-tail>` — so reusing a map field name
(`OUT.BIRTH = …` when `BIRTH` is also a local variable) silently
writes the wrong tail.

The convention used by `runtime/rexx/cust.rexx` is to give locals
distinct names from map fields (`AKT` vs `ACTION`, `CKEY` vs
`CUSTNO`, `BSTR` / `NDAYS` vs `BIRTH` / `DAYS`).

### COBOL data names across groups

A child name reused across groups is allowed; bare references that
match more than one declaration must be qualified with `OF` / `IN`
(`MOVE x OF DET TO y OF SCR`). Bare names that are unique across
the program continue to work without qualification. Sibling
duplicates within a single group are still rejected at parse time
because no qualifier can disambiguate them.

### 3270 has no LF...obviously.

`SEND TEXT` lays its body out as a flat row-major buffer, every
`cols` bytes wrapping to the next row. Programs that expect newline
semantics must pad each logical line to the column width
(`LEFT(s,80)` in REXX, `PIC X(80)` group children in COBOL) and
concatenate.

Kinda obvious, but just making sure it's clear to folks who are new to 3270.


### Reset stems before paginated reads

A REXX `STEM.` accumulator that's reused across pages will leak
values from the previous page if not dropped. Use `DROP RECS.` (with
the trailing dot) at the top of each pagination loop.

### EIBAID comparison

In REXX, compare `C2X(EIBAID)` to a hex string: `IF C2X(EIBAID) = 'F3'
THEN ...` (PF3). In COBOL, compare `EIBAID` directly to a hex
literal: `IF EIBAID = X'F3' ...`.
